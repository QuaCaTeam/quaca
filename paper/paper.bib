  abstract = {Spatially separated bodies in a relative motion through vacuum experience a tiny friction force known as quantum friction (QF). This force has so far eluded experimental detection due to its small magnitude and short range. Quantitative details revealing traces of the QF in the degradation of the quantum coherence of a particle are presented. Environmentally induced decoherence for a particle sliding over a dielectric sheet can be decomposed into contributions of different signatures: one solely induced by the electromagnetic vacuum in the presence of the dielectric and another induced by motion. As the geometric phase (GP) has been proved to be a fruitful venue of investigation to infer features of the quantum systems, herein it is proposed to use the accumulated GP acquired by a particle as a QF sensor. Furthermore, an innovative experiment designed to track traces of QF by measuring the velocity dependence of corrections to the GP and coherence is proposed. The experimentally viable scheme presented can spark renewed optimism for the detection of non-contact friction, with the hope that this non-equilibrium phenomenon can be readily measured soon.},

  abstract = {The geometric phase can be used as a fruitful venue of investigation to infer features of the quantum systems. Its application can reach new theoretical frontiers and imply innovative and challenging experimental proposals. Herein, we take advantage of the geometric phase to sense the corrections induced while a neutral particle travels at constant velocity in front of an imperfect sheet in quantum vacuum. As it is already known, two bodies in relative motion at constant velocity experience a quantum contactless dissipative force, known as quantum friction. This force has eluded experimental detection so far due to its small magnitude and short range. However, we give details of an innovative experiment designed to track traces of the quantum friction by measuring the velocity dependence of corrections to the geometric phase. We notice that the environmentally induced corrections can be decomposed in different contributions: corrections induced by the presence of the dielectric sheet and the motion of the particle in quantum vacuum. As the geometric phase accumulates over time, its correction becomes relevant at a relative short timescale, while the system still preserves purity. The experimentally viable scheme presented would be the first one in tracking traces of quantum friction through the study of decoherence effects on a NV center in diamond.},

We show that the combination of nonequilibrium dynamics, the anomalous Doppler effect, and spin-momentum locking of light mediates an intriguing interplay between the atom's translational and rotational motion. In turn, this deeply affects the drag force in a way that is reminiscent of classical rolling friction. Our fully non-Markovian and nonequilibrium description reveals counterintuitive features characterizing the atom's velocity-dependent rotational dynamics. These results prompt interesting directions for tuning the interaction and for investigating nonequilibrium dynamics as well as the properties of confined light.},

Here we present a very general formulation of inverse design that is applicable to atomic interactions in external environments, and derive from this some explicit formulae for optimisation of spontaneous decay rates, Casimir–Polder forces and resonant energy transfer. Using Purcell enhancement of the latter as a simple example, we employ finite-difference time-domain techniques in a proof-of-principle demonstration of our formula, finding enhancement of the rate many orders of magnitude larger than a selection of traditional designs.},

  abstract   = {We investigate the nonconservative open-system dynamics of an atom in a generic complex structured electromagnetic environment at temperature \$T\$. In such systems, when the atom moves along a translation-invariant axis of the environment, a frictional force acts on the particle. The effective viscosity due to friction results from the nonequilibrium interaction with the fluctuating (quantum) electromagnetic field, which effectively sets a privileged reference frame. We study the impact of both quantum or thermal fluctuations on the interaction and highlight how they induce qualitatively different types of viscosity, i.e. quantum and black-body friction. To this end, we develop a self-consistent non-Markovian description that contains the latter as special cases. In particular, we show how the interplay between the nonequilibrium dynamics, the quantum and the thermal properties of the radiation, as well as the confinement of light at the vacuum-material interface is responsible for several interesting and intriguing features. Our analyses is relevant for a future experimental test of noncontact friction and the resulting electromagnetic viscosity.},

  abstract  = {The dissipative properties of spatially nonlocal conductors are investigated in the context of quantum friction acting on an atom moving above a macroscopic body. The focus is on an extended version of the hydrodynamic model for the bulk material\&\#x2019;s electromagnetic response. It is shown that the standard hydrodynamic description is inadequate for evaluating the frictional force, since it completely neglects Landau damping. The extended version of the model contains a frequency-dependent compressibility factor for the Fermi liquid and qualitatively resolves this issue. For a quantitative assessment, these results are contrasted with those obtained for the more fundamental Boltzmann\&\#x2013;Mermin model. Since the latter is technically involved, the simplicity of the extended hydrodynamic model allows for an easier analysis of the impact of nonlocality on quantum friction for other (planar) geometries. This is illustrated with an example involving a thin slab.},

  abstract   = {When two or more objects move relative to one another in vacuum, they experience a drag force, which, at zero temperature, usually goes under the name of quantum friction. This contactless non-conservative interaction is mediated by the fluctuations of the material-modified quantum electrodynamic vacuum and, hence, is purely quantum in nature. Numerous investigations have revealed the richness of the mechanisms at work, thereby stimulating novel theoretical and experimental approaches and identifying challenges and opportunities. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the physics surrounding quantum friction and a perspective on recent developments.},

We also review the basic principles of standard computational methods, categorizing them according to three criteria---choice of problem, basis, and solution technique---that can be used to classify proposals for the Casimir problem as well. In this way, mature classical methods can be exploited to model Casimir physics, with a few important modifications.},

  abstract = {For more than 35 years theorists have studied quantum or Casimir friction, which occurs when two smooth bodies move transversely to each other, experiencing a frictional dissipative force due to quantum electromagnetic fluctuations, which break time-reversal symmetry. These forces are typically very small, unless the bodies are nearly touching, and consequently such effects have never been observed, although lateral Casimir forces have been seen for corrugated surfaces. Partly because of the lack of contact with observations, theoretical predictions for the frictional force between parallel plates, or between a polarizable atom and a metallic plate, have varied widely. Here, we review the history of these calculations, show that theoretical consensus is emerging, and offer some hope that it might be possible to experimentally confirm this phenomenon of dissipative quantum electrodynamics.},
