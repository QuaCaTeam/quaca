  abstract = {The geometric phase can be used as a fruitful venue of investigation to infer features of the quantum systems. Its application can reach new theoretical frontiers and imply innovative and challenging experimental proposals. Herein, we take advantage of the geometric phase to sense the corrections induced while a neutral particle travels at constant velocity in front of an imperfect sheet in quantum vacuum. As it is already known, two bodies in relative motion at constant velocity experience a quantum contactless dissipative force, known as quantum friction. This force has eluded experimental detection so far due to its small magnitude and short range. However, we give details of an innovative experiment designed to track traces of the quantum friction by measuring the velocity dependence of corrections to the geometric phase. We notice that the environmentally induced corrections can be decomposed in different contributions: corrections induced by the presence of the dielectric sheet and the motion of the particle in quantum vacuum. As the geometric phase accumulates over time, its correction becomes relevant at a relative short timescale, while the system still preserves purity. The experimentally viable scheme presented would be the first one in tracking traces of quantum friction through the study of decoherence effects on a NV center in diamond.},

  abstract = {An atom moving in a vacuum at constant velocity and parallel to a surface experiences a frictional force induced by the dissipative interaction with the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. We show that the combination of nonequilibrium dynamics, the anomalous Doppler effect, and spin-momentum locking of light mediates an intriguing interplay between the atom's translational and rotational motion. In turn, this deeply affects the drag force in a way that is reminiscent of classical rolling friction. Our fully non-Markovian and nonequilibrium description reveals counterintuitive features characterizing the atom's velocity-dependent rotational dynamics. These results prompt interesting directions for tuning the interaction and for investigating nonequilibrium dynamics as well as the properties of confined light.},

  abstract = {The dissipative properties of spatially nonlocal conductors are investigated in the context of quantum friction acting on an atom moving above a macroscopic body. The focus is on an extended version of the hydrodynamic model for the bulk material's electromagnetic response. It is shown that the standard hydrodynamic description is inadequate for describing the frictional force since it completely neglects Landau damping. The extended version of the model contains a frequency-dependent compressibility factor for the Fermi liquid and qualitatively resolves this issue. For a quantitative assessment, these results are contrasted with those obtained for the more fundamental Boltzmann-Mermin model. Since the latter is technically involved, the simplicity of the extended hydrodynamic model allows for an easier analysis of the impact of nonlocality on quantum friction for other (planar) geometries. This is illustrated with an example involving a thin slab.},
