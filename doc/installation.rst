Installation
************

To build QuaCa from source simply clone the git repository via::

    $ git clone git@git.physik.hu-berlin.de:egerlanc/quaca.git

Note that this repository is not public, so for now you need to ask the developers for access.
To build the project type::

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The default directory for installation is ``/usr/local/bin`` and can be changed in the makefile.


Dependencies
============

QuaCa largely depends on standard libraries and uses GCC to compile the project.
