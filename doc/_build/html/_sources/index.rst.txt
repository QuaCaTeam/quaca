**QuaCa** stands for Quantum / Casimir Friction and is a numerical framework to calculate just that.
With QuaCa you can calculate quantum friction at finite temperatures, with atoms or nanoparticles, rolling or non-rolling, etc.
For an introduction into the mathematical apparatus behind QuaCa see references [1] and [2].

QuaCa is free software distributed under WTFPL.

QuaCa is currently developed in a private git repository, by main developer and maintainer Marty Oelschlager (marty@mbi-berlin.de) with help of co-developer `Christoph Egerland <https://cheger.land>`_.
