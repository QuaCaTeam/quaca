# Write your own main

- small sum up of last tutorial
- let the user implement a small feature in a separate main file (i.e. calculate a polarizability tensor)
- let the user implement the last tutorial, but not with a .ini file
- see that the results are the same and for repetative tasks it is better to write with .ini files
