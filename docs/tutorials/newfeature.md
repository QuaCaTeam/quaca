# Implement a new feature
For now we have played around with the main functions and executables.
In this tutorial we will add a feature to QuaCa, calculate the quantum friction with the new feature and see what changes.

The new feature we are going to implement is a new permittivity.
More specifically we want to implement a Lorentz model of the form
$$
\varepsilon(\omega) = \frac{\alpha_0}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}
$$
