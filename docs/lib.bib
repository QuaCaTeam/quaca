  abstract = {The linear response theory of systems obeying Fokker-Planck equations is discussed under the assumption that the principle of detailed balance is satisfied. This theory is used to obtain fluctuation-dissipation theorems for systems in a non-thermal equilibrium state corresponding to the steady state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. Some of the aspects of the threshold region of a single mode laser (without detuning) are discussed. In particular it is shown that, contrary to the results established recently by others, the ``linear susceptibility'' {$\chi$}(\${\O}mega\$) is acontinuous function of the pump parameterp. The results are then specialized to Gaussian Markov process in which case an alternate form of the fluctuation-dissipation theorems is also given. Finally few other generalizations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorems are also briefly discussed.},

We discuss advances in this field, dealing in particular with multilayer systems fabricated from metals and/or semiconductors. After reviewing previous work on thin films, we describe results obtained using transfer-matrix methods for the bulk and surface plasmon-polaritons in two-component (or binary) superlattices formed from a periodic array of alternating layers of two different materials. Generalizations to more complex structures are then given, including n-i-p-i semiconductor superlattices, Fibonacci-like superlattices, and superlattices in which some of the layers are piezoelectric materials. Magnetic-field effects are also discussed in terms of magnetoplasmon-polaritons in superlattices. A discussion is given of some of the spectroscopic techniques applicable to plasmon-polaritons in multilayer systems, where we emphasize Raman scattering and far-infrared attenuated total reflection. Finally, some nonlinear effects involving surface plasmon-polaritons are described.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The fitting of metal optical properties is a topic that has applications in advanced simulations of spectroscopy, plasmonics, and optical engineering. In particular, the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) requires an analytical model of dispersion that verifies specific conditions to produce a full spectrum in a single run. Combination of Drude and Lorentz models, and Drude and critical points models, are known to be efficient, but the number of parameters to be adjusted for fitting data can prevent accurate results from simulated annealing or Nelder-Mead. The complex number relative permittivities of Au, Ag, Al, Cr, and Ti from either Palik or Johnson and Christy experimental data in the visible domain of wavelengths are successfully fitted by using the result of the particle swarm optimization method with FDTD constraint, as a starting point for the Nelder-Mead method. The results are well positioned compared to those that can be found in the literature. The results can be used directly for numerical simulations in the visible domain. The method can be applied to other materials, such as dielectrics, and to other domain of wavelengths.},

Dissipation then does not occur as a perturbation, but rather as the main resource for many-body dynamics, providing a targeted cooling into topological phases starting from arbitrary initial states. We explore the concept of topological order in this setting, developing and applying a general theoretical framework based on the system density matrix that replaces the wave function appropriate for the discussion of Hamiltonian ground-state physics. We identify key analogies and differences to the more conventional Hamiltonian scenario. Differences essentially arise from the fact that the properties of the spectrum and of the state of the system are not as tightly related as in the Hamiltonian context. We provide a symmetry-based topological classification of bulk steady states and identify the classes that are achievable by means of quasi-local dissipative processes driving into superfluid paired states. We also explore the fate of the bulk-edge correspondence in the dissipative setting and demonstrate the emergence of Majorana edge modes. We illustrate our findings in one- and two-dimensional models that are experimentally realistic in the context of cold atoms.},

In diesem Zusammenhang wird das Postulat der Eichinvarianz von L in einer etwas abweichenden Weise formuliert. In \textsection{} 3 werden dann die Ausdr{\"u}cke f{\"u}r die Energiedichte, den totalen Drehimpuls, das Bahnimpulsmoment, das Spinimpulsmoment und die Dichten dieser Gr{\"o}ssen aus den Prinzipien der allgemeinen Relativit{\"a}ts-theorie hergeleitet. Es ergeben sich dann Ausdr{\"u}cke, welche schon in einer fr{\"u}heren Abhandlung vom Verfasser angedeutet wurden, und durch welche diese Gr{\"o}ssen sich aus dem Wirkungsintegranden L berechnen lassen ohne irgend welchen Bezug auf allgemeine Relativit{\"a}t. Der Wirkungsintegrand L ist aber nur bis auf einer Divergenz bestimmt, wenn sein Integral L vorgegeben ist. Es wird in \textsection{} 4 diskutiert, inwieweit dieser Umstand die Ausdr{\"u}cke f{\"u}r die genannten Gr{\"o}ssen beeinflusst. Insbesondere wird auch untersucht, ob die Ausdr{\"u}cke f{\"u}r elektrische Ladungsdichte und Energiedichte und die Zerlegung des Total-drehimpulses in Bahnmoment und Spinmoment eindeutig bestimmt sind, wenn die Wirkungsfunktion L nur bis auf diejenigen Terme vorgegeben ist, welche die Wechselwirkung der ``materiellen'' Felder mit dem Maxwellschen Feld und dem Gravitationsfeld bestimmen. Es zeigt sich, dass dieses nur der Fall ist f{\"u}r Lagrangesche Funktionen ``erster Ordnung'', d.h. solche, aus denen sich Feldgleichungen erster Ordnung herleiten lassen. Im {\"u}brigen ergibt sich: 1. Solange Gravitationseffekte vernachl{\"a}ssigt werden, geben Gesamtenergie und Gesamtdrehimpuls nie Anlass zu Mehrdeutigkeiten. 2. Die Dichten dieser Gr{\"o}ssen sind im Falle einer Lagrangeschen Funktion ``zweiter Ordnung'', selbst in unrelativistischer N{\"a}herung, nur dann eindeutig bestimmt, wenn die Wirkungsfunktion L in allgemein-relativistischer Form genau vorgegeben ist. (F{\"u}r Lagrangesche Funktionen erster Ordnung ist solches nicht erforderlich). 3. Aber auch dann noch bleibt die Zerlegung des Gesamtdrehimpulses in Bahnmoment und Spinmoment unbestimmt im Falle Lagrangescher Funktionen zweiter Ordnung. (Hingegen braucht eine Lagrangesche Funktion erster Ordnung nur unter Vernachl{\"a}ssigung von Gravitationstermen gegeben zu sein, um diese Zerlegung v{\"o}llig zu bedingen). 4. Die Spin- und Bahnmomentdichten sind nie eindeutig festgelegt.},

  issn = {0001-8686},
  abstract = {Calculations of Hamaker constants using Lifshitz theory require the availability of accurate dielectric data, especially in the ultraviolet spectral region, and the use of a convenient and appropriate mathematical representation. In this review, a multiple oscillator model \textemdash{} the so-called Ninham-Parsegian (N-P) representation \textemdash{} has been used and spectral parameters for 31 different inorganic materials (including diamond) have been generated from critically evaluated optical data or collected from the literature. For most materials, a two-oscillator model (one UV and one IR term) was used but more detailed representations were included when available. The spectral parameters presented here can be combined with previous data, mainly focused on hydrocarbon and organic systems, to yield an extensive spectral data base for both solids and liquids enabling Lifshitz calculations of Hamaker constants for many materials combinations. Non-retarded Hamaker constants for symmetric material combinations across vacuum (A1v1) and water (A1w1) have been calculated for the different materials; these calculations were performed using the full Lifshitz theory. Asymmetric combinations, A1v3 and A1w3, against four commonly used materials in atomic force microscopy studies: silica, amorphous silicon nitride, sapphire, and muscovite mica, have also been covered. The use of a new dielectric representation for water resulted in significantly lower values of A1w1 compared to previous calculations. Analytical approximations to the full Lifshitz theory were evaluated and found to give surprisingly accurate results (the Tabor-Winterton approximation) for A1v1 when the IR contribution is of minor importance. An attempt to make the TW approximation more general by establishing some scaling relationship between n0 and {$\omega$}UV was met with little success; only the UV spectral parameters of the covalent oxides, sulphides and nitrides may be fitted to a simple power law relation. The Lifshitz calculations in this study were compared with an alternative method where a more detailed dielectric representation in the visible-ultraviolet spectral range was obtained through Kramers-Kronig (K-K) transformation of reflectivity data over a broad frequency range. Despite the difference in dielectric information, the two methods generally yield non-retarded Hamaker constants which do not differ significantly. This is not true for all materials, e.g. water, where a more detailed representation using either an N-P representation with several oscillators or the K-K representation must be used. It was shown that the omission of the static and low frequency contribution in the latter method may result in a significant underestimation of the value for A1w1 when the dispersive contribution becomes very small.},

These stereotypes discourage women's pursuit of many prestigious careers; that is, women are underrepresented in fields whose members cherish brilliance (such as physics and philosophy). Here we show that these stereotypes are endorsed by, and influence the interests of, children as young as 6. Specifically, 6-year-old girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are ``really, really smart.'' Also at age 6, girls begin to avoid activities said to be for children who are ``really, really smart.''

  abstract = {Many coatings and surface treatments have been developed to enhance component performance and, increasingly, coating architectures are becoming more complex as multilayer, superlattice and graded coating systems are becoming widely available. There are so many potential coating variants that it is almost impossible to test all the possibilities to optimise performance. Therefore the need for predictive performance models is increasing but model development has generally lagged behind the introduction of new coatings. For tribological coatings, the mechanical response to contact is particularly important if performance is to be understood. This paper briefly reviews developments in numerical simulation and extends recent modelling developments in an energy-based predictive model for the hardness and Young's modulus of a coated system. The model can be applied to single layer of multilayer coatings successfully. Model predictions can be improved by considering the through-thickness fracture behaviour of the coating.},

  abstract = {The problem concerning the fluctuation electromagnetic interaction of a neutral particle moving parallel to the boundary of a semi-infinite homogeneous isotropic medium characterized by a permittivity and permeability dependent on the frequency is considered in terms of the fluctuation electrodynamic theory within the relativistic formalism. It is assumed that, in the general case, the particle and the medium have different temperatures. Within the proposed approach, general expressions are derived both for conservative (normal to the boundary of the medium) and nonconservative (tangential) forces of the interaction between the particle and the medium and for the thermal heating (cooling) rate of the particle. In the nonrelativistic limit (c \textrightarrow {$\infty$}), the derived relationships coincide with nonrelativistic analogs available in the literature. It is demonstrated that the tangential force acting on the particle can be either accelerating or decelerating. There can occur a situation when the hot moving particle will be heated and the cold medium will be cooled. The interaction of the high-conductivity medium with a high-conductivity particle is analyzed numerically. The asymptotics of the radiative contributions to the heat flux and the tangential force is investigated. It is shown that the inclusion of the relativistic effects leads to a substantial increase in the tangential force and the heat flux at distances greater than 1 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m (as compared to the nonrelativistic case); however, the corresponding dependences exhibit a monotonic decreasing behavior over the entire range of studied distances (from zero to several hundreds of microns).},

  abstract = {Jaynes' information theory formalism of statistical mechanics is applied to the stationary states of open, non-equilibrium systems. First, it is shown that the probability distribution p {$\Gamma$} of the underlying microscopic phase space trajectories {$\Gamma$} over a time interval of length {$\tau$} satisfies p {$\Gamma$} \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/propto.gif] propto exp( {$\tau\sigma$} {$\Gamma$} /2 k B ) where {$\sigma$} {$\Gamma$} is the time-averaged rate of entropy production of {$\Gamma$}. Three consequences of this result are then derived: (1) the fluctuation theorem, which describes the exponentially declining probability of deviations from the second law of thermodynamics as {$\tau$} \textrightarrow {$\infty$}; (2) the selection principle of maximum entropy production for non-equilibrium stationary states, empirical support for which has been found in studies of phenomena as diverse as the Earth's climate and crystal growth morphology; and (3) the emergence of self-organized criticality for flux-driven systems in the slowly-driven limit. The explanation of these results on general information theoretic grounds underlines their relevance to a broad class of stationary, non-equilibrium systems. In turn, the accumulating empirical evidence for these results lends support to Jaynes' formalism as a common predictive framework for equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.},

  abstract = {Float glass substrates covered by high quality \{ITO\} thin films (Balzers) were subjected for an hour to single thermal treatments at different temperature between 100 \textdegree{}C and 600 \textdegree{}C. In order to study the electric and optical properties of both annealed and not annealed ITO-covered float glasses, ellipsometry, spectrophotometry, impedance analysis, and X-ray measurements were performed. Moreover, variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry provides relevant information on the electronic and optical properties of the samples. \{ITO\} film is modeled as a dense lower layer and a surface roughness layer. The estimated optical density for \{ITO\} and the optical density of the surface roughness \{ITO\} layer increases with the annealing temperature. In the near-IR range, the extinction coefficient decreases while the maximum of the absorption in the near \{UV\} range shift towards low photon energy as the annealing temperature increases. Spectrophotometry was used to estimate the optical band-gap energy of the samples. The thermal annealing changes strongly the structural and optical properties of \{ITO\} thin films, because during the thermal processes, the \{ITO\} thin film absorbs oxygen from air. This oxygen absorption decreases the oxygen vacancies therefore the defect densities in the crystalline structure of the \{ITO\} thin films also decrease, as confirmed both by ellipsometry and X-ray measurements.},

Classical electrodynamics fails to describe this coupling across sub-nanometer gaps, where quantum effects become important owing to non-local screening and the spill-out of electrons. However, full quantum simulations are not presently feasible for realistically sized systems. Here we present a novel approach, the quantum-corrected model (QCM), that incorporates quantum-mechanical effects within a classical electrodynamic framework. The QCM approach models the junction between adjacent nanoparticles by means of a local dielectric response that includes electron tunnelling and tunnelling resistivity at the gap and can be integrated within a classical electrodynamical description of large and complex structures. The QCM predicts optical properties in excellent agreement with fully quantum mechanical calculations for small interacting systems, opening a new venue for addressing quantum effects in realistic plasmonic systems.},

The obtained effective impedance matrix allows one to relate a matrix to a PC, which includes all of its properties in terms of reflection from its interface. For one-dimensional photonic crystals or multilayer films, it is shown that a closed-form equation can be found for the effective impedance. For two-dimensional photonic crystals the impedance is obtained using the scattering matrices by solving a unilateral quadratic matrix equation. Several examples are outlined to validate the developed scheme. In the examples, the goal is mainly the computation of the reflection from a semi-infinite periodic structure when a plane wave illuminates its boundary.},

For conservative systems in thermal equilibrium the chaotic hypothesis implies the ergodic hypothesis. We outline a procedure to obtain the distribution {$\mu$}: it leads to a new unifying point of view for the phase space behavior of dissipative and conservative systems. The chaotic hypothesis is confirmed in a nontrivial, parameter-free, way by a recent computer experiment on the entropy production fluctuations in a shearing fluid far from equilibrium. Similar applications to other models are proposed, in particular to a model for the Kolmogorov-Obuchov theory for turbulent flow.},

  abstract = {For thirty years this has been the acknowledged standard in advanced classical mechanics courses. This classic book enables readers to make connections between classical and modern physics - an indispensable part of a physicist's education. In this new edition, Beams Medal winner Charles Poole and John Safko have updated the book to include the latest topics, applications, and notation, to reflect today's physics curriculum. They introduce readers to the increasingly important role that nonlinearities play in contemporary applications of classical mechanics. New numerical exercises help readers to develop skills in how to use computer techniques to solve problems in physics. Mathematical techniques are presented in detail so that the book remains fully accessible to readers who have not had an intermediate course in classical mechanics. For college instructors and students.},

The complex refractive index of thick densified chemical-vapour-deposited silicon oxide film was calculated and used further to obtain the dielectric response function of the sample. Vibrational modes were analysed by energy-loss functions for transverse and longitudinal optical phonons. In the 900\textendash{}1300 cm-1 spectral region, three vibrational modes with well-resolved TO\textendash{}LO phonon splitting were obtained. The phonon spectra appears as the smeared-out version of the crystalline counterpart, i.e. the {$\alpha$}-quartz. The most intense phonon couple at 1064 (TO), and 1248 cm-1 (LO) has the smallest damping and appears to be more crystalline-like than the remaining two. The broad frequency distribution of lattice-like phonon lines gives rise to frequency-dependent damping where the phonons only purely feel each other and have different phonon decays.},

  volume = {17},
  abstract = {The authors present a macroscopic non-local response theory which explicitly allows for scattering of the excitation at the surface of the medium. This response leads to one or two generalised additional boundary conditions (ABC). They derive compact and explicit formulae for the reflectivities (R s and R p ), which depend on a surface-scattering parameter U y (for s polarisation) or two parameters U x and U z (for p polarisation). By assigning U y , or U x and U z different numerical values, they obtain results corresponding to different special cases of the ABC. The model employed is appropriate to an isolated excitonic transition in an insulating solid and is applied to calculate the reflectivity spectrum of a model semiconductor. They find that the p-polarised reflectivity is relatively insensitive to the value of the parameter U z , which governs the behaviour of the normal component of the excitonic polarisation at the surface. As a rule, the greatest (smallest) deviations from local behaviour are found for the Pekar (Fuchs-Kliewer 1971) ABC. For the Agarwal et al. ABC (1981), non-local effects are of intermediate strength. The reflectivity for the Rimbey-Mahan ABC (1974), is nearly equal to that for the Pekar ABC and the same is true for the Ting et al. (1975) and Fuchs-Kliewer ABC. Results are presented for both frequency and angular scans.},

Phys. 12 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/12/11/113045] 113045 ). We show that the power dissipated into field excitations and the associated friction force depend on how the atom is boosted from being initially at rest to a configuration in which it is moving at constant velocity ( v ) parallel to the planar interface. In addition, we point out that there is a subtle cancellation between the one-photon and part of the two-photon dissipating power, resulting in a leading order contribution to the frictional power which goes as v 4 .

  abstract = {We analyze the fundamental properties of optical waves referred to as Tamm plasmon modes (TPMs) which are tied to the interface of a semi-infinite two-phase metallodielectric superlattice with an arbitrary homogeneous capping medium. Such modes offer new ways of achieving high electromagnetic field localization and spontaneous emission enhancement in the vicinity of the interface in conjunction with absorption loss management, which is crucial for future applications. The homointerface, formed when the capping medium has the same permittivity as one of the superlattice constituents, is found to support a TPM whose dispersion overlaps the single-interface surface plasmon polariton (SPP) dispersion but which has a cut off at the topological transition point. In contrast, a heterointerface formed for an arbitrary capping medium, is found to support multiple TPMs whose origin can be traced by considering the interaction between a single-interface SPP and the homointerface TPM burried under the top layer of the superlattice. By carrying out a systematic comparison between TPMs and single-interface SPPs, we find that the deviations are most pronounced in the vicinity of the transition frequency for superlattices in which dielectric layers are thicker than metallic ones.},

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

In addition to the well-known classification of the electromagnetic waves into forward and backward waves, the electrostatics-based sub-classification elucidates one-level finer details of the wave nature. For this purpose, a hypothetical process is devised by continuously varying the signal velocity. As a result, a given electromagnetic wave turns out to be related to a certain electrostatic state. By this way, the metal's material loss is found to play an essential role in inducing depthwise energy flows, although it has the usual detrimental role in wave attenuation. Depending on the wave direction, normal and inverted reflection peaks on resonant excitations are illustrated.},

  abstract = {In recent years, we have seen a rapid progress in the field of graphene plasmonics, motivated by graphene's unique electrical and optical properties, tunability, long-lived collective excitation and its extreme light confinement. Here, we review the basic properties of graphene plasmons: their energy dispersion, localization and propagation, plasmon\textendash{}phonon hybridization, lifetimes and damping pathways. The application space of graphene plasmonics lies in the technologically significant, but relatively unexploited terahertz to mid-infrared regime. We discuss emerging and potential applications, such as modulators, notch filters, polarizers, mid-infrared photodetectors, and mid-infrared vibrational spectroscopy, among many others.},

To clarify the content of the theory, we present here a formal analysis of the Van der Waals interaction between an atom and a solid, based on the approach of McLachlan. A key quantity in the theory is the response of the solid to an external, time-dependent dipole. This response is amenable to classical analysis, and we calculate it for a variety of model systems. When the solid may be treated as a continuum with a flat surface, the concept of surface impedance allows a convenient parameterization and we may incorporate thereby magnetic effects, non-local dielectric response, and the influence of finite layers in the solid. We also study the modifications induced by a rough surface, finding the average change in the coupling strength in the presence of weak roughness.},

  abstract = {For more than 35 years theorists have studied quantum or Casimir friction, which occurs when two smooth bodies move transversely to each other, experiencing a frictional dissipative force due to quantum electromagnetic fluctuations, which break time-reversal symmetry. These forces are typically very small, unless the bodies are nearly touching, and consequently such effects have never been observed, although lateral Casimir forces have been seen for corrugated surfaces. Partly because of the lack of contact with observations, theoretical predictions for the frictional force between parallel plates, or between a polarizable atom and a metallic plate, have varied widely. Here, we review the history of these calculations, show that theoretical consensus is emerging, and offer some hope that it might be possible to experimentally confirm this phenomenon of dissipative quantum electrodynamics.},

Modeling the particle as a silver nano-sphere, we investigate the spectrum of the force and its velocity dependence. We find that the damping of the plasmon resonance in the silver particle has a relatively strong impact near the Cherenkov threshold velocity.

Although temperature is an old and well-established notion, it still presents controversial facets. After a short historical survey of the key role of temperature in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, we tackle a series of issues which have been recently reconsidered. In particular, we discuss different definitions and their relevance for energy fluctuations. The interest in such a topic has been triggered by the recent observation of negative temperatures in condensed matter experiments. Moreover, the ability to manipulate systems at the micro and nano-scale urges to understand and clarify some aspects related to the statistical properties of small systems (as the issue of temperature's ``fluctuations''). We also discuss the notion of temperature in a dynamical context, within the theory of linear response for Hamiltonian systems at equilibrium and stochastic models with detailed balance, and the generalized fluctuation\textendash{}response relations, which provide a hint for an extension of the definition of temperature in far-from-equilibrium systems. To conclude we consider non-Hamiltonian systems, such as granular materials, turbulence and active matter, where a general theoretical framework is still lacking.},

For a truncated superlattice constituted of nonabsorbing dielectric layers, we demonstrate that the numerical solutions obtained by this method for transverse-electric waves agree with those based on the Bloch theory for the semi-infinite superlattice. A slab of superlattice with at least nine unit cells yields satisfactory convergence to an analytic dispersion relation for the surface modes. In addition, we apply the supercell method to study in detail the dependence of transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic surface waves on the cut-off position in the cell next to the surface. As a specific case, we choose a TiO2/SiO2 superlattice\textemdash{}layers with relatively high dielectric contrast in the visible spectrum. We find the surface modes strongly dependent on the position of the surface. In fact, they appear only for certain terminations. By plotting the field amplitudes, we show that there exist different possibilities for the guidance of surface waves. The variation of the penetration depth of these modes is also discussed.},

This approach enables the rigorous identification of many interesting features including the intersections between plasmonic bands, flat or negative band formation, and the field symmetry of the propagating modes. Furthermore \textendash{} the ``gap-slab competition'' concept allows us to develop design tools for incorporating desired dispersion properties of both gap and slab modes into the stack's band structure, as well as effects of finite stack termination.},

For a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), the corresponding FDT is shown to involve in the correlation function a variable that is conjugate with respect to entropy . By splitting up entropy production into one of the system and one of the medium, it is shown that for systems with a genuine equilibrium state the FDT of the NESS differs from its equilibrium form by an additive term involving total entropy production. A related variant of the FDT not requiring explicit knowledge of the stationary state is particularly useful for coupled Langevin systems. The a priori surprising freedom apparently involved in different forms of the FDT in a NESS is clarified.},

These artificial materials support unique bulk electromagnetic states which can tailor light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. We present a unified view of practical approaches to achieve hyperbolic dispersion using thin film and nanowire structures. We also review current research in the field of hyperbolic metamaterials such as sub-wavelength imaging and broadband photonic density of states engineering. The review introduces the concepts central to the theory of hyperbolic media as well as nanofabrication and characterization details essential to experimentalists.

We have measured the resonant frequencies of split ring resonators and square loops fabricated on Si wafers with silicon dioxide thicknesses ranging from 0 to 10 nm. Resonance features blue shift with increasing silicon dioxide thickness. These effects are explained by the silicon dioxide layer forming a series capacitance to the fringing field across the elements. Resonance coupling to the Si-O vibrational absorption has been observed. Native oxide layers which are normally ignored in numerical simulations of metamaterials must be accounted for to produce accurate predictions.},

  abstract = {Graphene is a typical two-dimensional (2D) allotrope form of carbon. Excellent optical and electric properties of graphene, such as broadband absorption and high mobility of carriers, promise prosperous applications in optic and optoelectronic devices. However, flat graphene structures (either graphene film on a structural substrate or structural graphene) hardly support efficient excitation of high-order plasmonic modes, which results in a serious deficiency in realizing efficient light\textendash{}matter interaction in graphene-based devices. Here, by configuring the flat graphene into complex three-dimensional (3D) pillars, strong high-order plasmonic modes were observed and verified numerically and experimentally. It is found that, despite the influence of geometry and material parameters on resonance, the excitation efficiency of high-order modes is highly dependent on the graphene on the sidewall of pillars. Therefore, the proposed 3D graphene structures not only retain the merits of 2D materials but also introduce a new dimension to control the light\textendash{}matter interaction. In addition, the fabrication technique in this work can be readily applied to other 2D materials with various geometric shapes. It is believed that the proposed 3D form of 2D materials will ignite a plethora of unprecedented designs and applications in THz communication such as THz pulse generators, modulators, detectors, and spectrometers.},

Although thermodynamics works perfectly in all cases when the notion of entropic force is used, no effort is typically made to explain the mechanical nature of the forces. In this paper we discuss the nature of entropic forces as conditional means of constraint forces in systems where interactions are taken into account as mechanical constraints and discuss several examples of such forces. We moreover demonstrate how these forces appear within the standard formalism of statistical thermodynamics and within the mechanical approach based on the Pope\textendash{}Ching equation, making evident their connection with the equipartition of energy. The paper is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students studying statistical physics and the teachers teaching it.},

  abstract = {The dispersion energy is an important contribution to the total solvation energies of ions and neutral molecules. Here, we present a new continuum model calculation of these energies, based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. The model uses the frequency dependent multipole polarizabilities of molecules in order to accurately calculate the dispersion interaction of a solute particle with surrounding water molecules. It includes the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole moment contributions. The water is modeled via a bulk dielectric susceptibility with a spherical cavity occupied by the solute. The model invokes damping functions to account for solute-solvent wave function overlap. The assumptions made are very similar to those used in the Born model. This provides consistency and additivity of electrostatic and dispersion (quantum mechanical) interactions. The energy increases in magnitude with cation size, but decreases slightly with size for the highly polarizable anions. The higher order multipole moments are essential, making up more than 50\% of the dispersion solvation energy of the fluoride ion. This method provides an accurate and simple way of calculating the notoriously problematic dispersion contribution to the solvation energy. The result establishes the importance of using accurate calculations of the dispersion energy for the modeling of solvation.},

The direct impact of the external driving on the environment is generally neglected. While this approach is satisfactory for macroscopic systems, on the nanoscale, an interaction of external fields with the environment is often unavoidable on principle. We extend the standard linear response theory of quantum dissipative systems to strongly driven baths. Significant modifications are found for two paradigm examples. First, we evaluate the polarizability of a molecule immersed in a strongly polarizable medium that responds to terahertz radiation. We find an increase of the molecular polarizability by about 30\%. Second, we determine the response of a semiconductor quantum dot in close proximity to a metallic nanoparticle. Both are placed in a polarizable medium and exposed to electromagnetic irradiation. We show that the response of the quantum dot is qualitatively modified by the driven nanoparticle, including the generation of an additional channel of stimulated emission.},

In this sense, the calculation demonstrates that the atoms are subject to nonzero frictional resistance, with the immediate implication that friction is experienced also by an atom moving outside and parallel to the surface of an electrically dilute and nonabsorptive half-space. The next paper in this series finds the friction experienced by an atom outside a half-space which may be absorptive and electrically dense.},

  abstract = {The amazing adhesion of gecko pads to almost any kind of surfaces has inspired a very active research direction over the last decade: the investigation of how geckos achieve this feat and how this knowledge can be turned into new strategies to reversibly join surfaces. This article reviews the fabrication approaches used so far for the creation of micro- and nanostructured fibrillar surfaces with adhesive properties. In the light of the pertinent contact mechanics, the adhesive properties are presented and discussed. The decisive design parameters are fiber radius and aspect ratio, tilt angle, hierarchical arrangement and the effect of the backing layer. Also first responsive systems that allow thermal switching between nonadhesive and adhesive states are described. These structures show a high potential of application, providing the remaining issues of robustness, reliability, and large-area manufacture can be solved.},

Due to recent progress in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, it is possible to fabricate highly sophisticated multiscale, hierarchical structures using various polymer materials. In addition, the adhesion strength of synthetic dry adhesives has been shown to be similar to or exceed that of real gecko foot-hair by several times. Therefore, it is timely and appropriate to drive the research of gecko-inspired dry adhesives into a new epoch by investigating more robust dry adhesive structures, efficient detachment mechanisms, and new applications. In this Feature Article, we present a series of our recent achievements to overcome some of the limitations of gecko-like hair structures such as rough surface adaptation, durability, and controlled geometry, with particular emphasis on materials issues and detachment mechanism. For potential applications, a clean transportation device and a biomedical skin patch are briefly described to expand the application realm from the well-known wall climbing robot.},

  volume = {313},
  abstract = {The vacuum is the lowest energy state of a field in a certain region of space. This definition implies that no particles can be present in the vacuum state. In classical physics, the only features of vacuum are those of its geometry. For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a dynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent and curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is a structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are strictly associated with physical objects such as particles and finite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As I will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum physics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example that physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only when the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach properties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing real objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain perturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy shifts and creation of particles. An open question is if by necessity the vacuum comes with an embedded geometry, and if it is possible to construct viable physical theories in which geometry is detached from the vacuum.},

The robot employs several design principles adapted from the gecko including a hierarchy of compliant structures, directional adhesion, and control of tangential contact forces to achieve control of adhesion. We describe the design and fabrication methods used to create underactuated, multimaterial structures that conform to surfaces over a range of length scales from centimeters to micrometers. At the finest scale, the undersides of Stickybot's toes are covered with arrays of small, angled polymer stalks. Like the directional adhesive structures used by geckos, they readily adhere when pulled tangentially from the tips of the toes toward the ankles; when pulled in the opposite direction, they release. Working in combination with the compliant structures and directional adhesion is a force control strategy that balances forces among the feet and promotes smooth attachment and detachment of the toes.},

Lithographic approaches are capable of creating freestanding objects in silicon and other materials, with thickness and lateral dimensions down to about 20 nanometers.

  abstract = {The low mass and high quality factors that nanomechanical resonators exhibit lead to exceptional sensitivity in the frequency domain. This is especially appealing for the design of ultrasensitive force and mass sensors. The sensitivity of a nanomechanical mass and force sensor depends on its mass and quality factor; a low resonator mass and a higher quality factor reduce both the minimum resolvable mass and force. Graphene, a single atomic layer thick membrane is an ideal candidate for nanoelectromechanical resonators due to its extremely low mass and high stiffness. Here, we show that by employing the intrinsic piezoresistivity of graphene to transduce its motion in nanoelectromechanical systems, we approach a force resolution of 16.3 {$\pm$} 0.8 aN/Hz1/2 and a minimum detectable mass of 1.41 {$\pm$} 0.02 zeptograms (10-21 g) at ambient temperature. Quality factors of the driven response of the order of 103 at pressures {$\sim$}10-6 Torr on several devices are also observed. Moreover, we demonstrate this at ambient temperature on chemical-vapor-deposition-grown graphene to allow for scale-up, thus demonstrating its potential for applications requiring exquisite force and mass resolution such as mass spectroscopy and magnetic resonance force microscopy.},

Therewith by use of energy dissipation the formalism becomes more manageable and transparent than in the conventional setting where uniform sliding motion is assumed from t = -{$\infty$} to t = +{$\infty$}. One avoids separating off a reversible interparticle force (independent of friction) from the total force. Moreover, the cases of temperatures T = 0 and finite T are treated on the same footing. For metal plates we find the friction force to be proportional to v3 at T = 0 while at finite T it is proportional to v for small v as found earlier. Comparisons with earlier results of Pendry [J.

  abstract = {The Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) can be derived from a particle-bath Hamiltonian, in both classical and quantum dynamics, and provides a route to the (both Markovian and non-Markovian) fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). All previous studies have focused either on particle-bath systems with time-independent external forces only, or on the simplified case where only the tagged particle is subject to the external time-dependent oscillatory field. Here we extend the GLE and the corresponding FDT for the more general case where both the tagged particle and the bath oscillators respond to an external oscillatory field. This is the example of a charged or polarisable particle immersed in a bath of other particles that are also charged or polarizable, under an external AC electric field. For this Hamiltonian, we find that the ensemble average of the stochastic force is not zero, but proportional to the AC field. The associated FDT reads as \$\textbackslash{}langle F\_P(t)F\_P(t')\textbackslash{}rangle=mk\_BT\textbackslash{}nu(t-t')+(\textbackslash{}gamma e)\^2E(t)E(t')\$, where \$F\_\{p\}\$ is the random force, \$\textbackslash{}nu(t-t')\$ is the friction memory function, and \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ is a numerical prefactor.},

Similar to the way silicon revolutionized the microelectronics industry, the proper materials can greatly impact the field of plasmonics and metamaterials. Currently, research in plasmonics and metamaterials lacks good material building blocks in order to realize useful devices. Such devices suffer from many drawbacks arising from the undesirable properties of their material building blocks, especially metals. There are many materials, other than conventional metallic components such as gold and silver, that exhibit metallic properties and provide advantages in device performance, design flexibility, fabrication, integration, and tunability. This review explores different material classes for plasmonic and metamaterial applications, such as conventional semiconductors, transparent conducting oxides, perovskite oxides, metal nitrides, silicides, germanides, and 2D materials such as graphene. This review provides a summary of the recent developments in the search for better plasmonic materials and an outlook of further research directions.},

For a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of adhesion it is necessary to seek quantitative information about the involved interactions. Most studies concentrate on the modification of the surface (chemical composition, hydrophobicity, or topography) neglecting, however, the influence of the bulk material, which always contributes to the overall interaction via van der Waals forces. In this study, we applied AFM force spectroscopy and flow chamber experiments to probe the adhesion of Staphylococcus carnosus to a set of tailored Si wafers, allowing for a separation of shortand long-range forces. We provide experimental evidence that the subsurface composition of a substrate influences bacterial adhesion. A coarse estimation of the strength of the van der Waals forces via the involved Hamaker constants substantiates the experimental results. The results demonstrate that the uppermost layer is not solely responsible for the strength of adhesion. Rather, for all kinds of adhesion studies, it is equally important to consider the contribution of the subsurface.},

  volume = {6},
  issn = {1662-5145},
  abstract = {Conscious `free will' is problematic because 1) brain mechanisms causing consciousness are unknown, 2) measurable brain activity correlating with conscious perception apparently occurs too late for real-time conscious response, consciousness thus being considered `epiphenomenal illusion', and 3) determinism, i.e. our actions and the world around us seem algorithmic and inevitable. The Penrose-Hameroff theory of `orchestrated objective reduction' (`Orch OR') identifies discrete conscious moments with quantum computations in microtubules inside brain neurons, e.g. 40 per second in concert with gamma synchrony EEG. Microtubules organize neuronal interiors and regulate synapses. In Orch OR, microtubule quantum computations occur in integration phases in dendrites and cell bodies of integrate-and-fire brain neurons connected and synchronized by gap junctions, allowing entanglement of microtubules among many neurons. Quantum computations in entangled microtubules terminate by Penrose `objective reduction' (`OR'), a proposal for quantum state reduction and conscious moments linked to fundamental spacetime geometry. Each OR reduction selects microtubule states which can trigger axonal firings, and control behavior. The quantum computations are `orchestrated' by synaptic inputs and memory (thus `Orch OR'). If correct, Orch OR can account for conscious causal agency, resolving problem 1. Regarding problem 2, Orch OR can cause temporal non-locality, sending quantum information backward in classical time, enabling conscious control of behavior. Three lines of evidence for brain backward time effects are presented. Regarding problem 3) Penrose OR (and Orch OR) invoke non-computable influences from information embedded in spacetime geometry, potentially avoiding algorithmic determinism. In summary, Orch OR can account for real-time conscious causal agency, avoiding the need for consciousness to be seen as epiphenomenal illusion. Orch OR can rescue conscious free will.},

The following article takes this starting point and focuses on epigenetics, a biomedical research area in which the crossing between nature and nurture is discussed and investigated. With an analysis of the epigenetic field of genomic imprinting we want to tackle the question in how far the overcoming of the dichotomies really happens so that we can show how sex and gender are discussed in epigenetics and which influence these concepts have on social gender relations.

  abstract = {To date, feminist approaches to neurosciences have evaluated the debates surrounding practices of knowledge production within and research results of contemporary brain research. Consequently, neurofeminist scholars have critically examined gendered impacts of neuroscientific research. More recently, feminist neuroscientists also develop research appraoches for more gender-appropriate neuroscientific research on several levels. Based on neurofeminist critique feminist neuroscientists aim to enrich neuroscientific work by offering methodological suggestions for a more differentiated setup of categories and experimental designs, for reflective result presentations and interpretations as well as for the analysis of result validity. Reframing neuro-epistemologies by including plasticity concepts works to uncover social influences on the gendered development of the brain and of behavior. More recently, critical work on contemporary neurocultures has highlighted the entanglements of neuroscientific research within society and the implications of `neurofacts' for gendered cultural symbolisms, social practices, and power relations. Not least, neurofeminism critically analyzes the portrayal of neuro-knowledge in popular media. This article presents on overview on neurofeminist debates and on current approaches of feminist neurosciences. The authors conclude their review by calling for a more gender-appropriate research approach that takes into account both its situatedness and reflections on the neuroscientific agenda, but also questions neurofeminist discourse in regards to uses and misuses of its concepts.},

Steam locomotives, cars, and the drinking bird toy all convert heat into useful work as it cycles between two reservoirs at different temperatures. Usually, the working substance where the heat-work conversion occurs is a liquid or a gas, consisting of many molecules. Ro{$\beta$}nagel et al. have made a working substance of a single calcium ion in a tapered ion trap. A laser-cooling beam plays the part of a cold reservoir for the calcium ion, and in turn, electric field noise acts as a hot reservoir.
Science, this issue p. 325
Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work and generally involve a large number of particles. We report the experimental realization of a single-atom heat engine. An ion is confined in a linear Paul trap with tapered geometry and driven thermally by coupling it alternately to hot and cold reservoirs. The output power of the engine is used to drive a harmonic oscillation. From direct measurements of the ion dynamics, we were able to determine the thermodynamic cycles for various temperature differences of the reservoirs. We then used these cycles to evaluate the power P and efficiency {$\eta$} of the engine, obtaining values up to P = 3.4 \texttimes{} 10\textendash{}22 joules per second and {$\eta$} = 0.28\%, consistent with analytical estimations. Our results demonstrate that thermal machines can be reduced to the limit of single atoms.

Particular attention is paid to the regime where transport occurs via incoherent Cooper-pair tunnelling (either via the Josephson quasiparticle (JQP) or double JQP (DJQP) process). We show that, surprisingly, the back-action of tunnelling Cooper pairs (or superconducting quasi-particles) can be used to significantly cool the oscillator. We also discuss the physical origin of negative-damping effects in this system and how they can lead to a regime of strong electromechanical feedback, where despite a weak SET\textendash{}oscillator coupling, the motion of the oscillator strongly effects the tunnelling of the Cooper pairs. We show that in this regime, the oscillator is characterized by an energy-dependent effective temperature. Finally, we discuss the strong analogy between back-action effects of incoherent Cooper-pair tunnelling and ponderomotive effects in an optical cavity with a moveable mirror; in our case, tunnelling Cooper pairs play the role of the cavity photons.},

  title = {Concepts of Quantum Non-{{Markovianity}}: {{A}} Hierarchy},
  issn = {03701573},
  shorttitle = {Concepts of Quantum Non-{{Markovianity}}},
  abstract = {Markovian approximation is a widely-employed idea in descriptions of the dynamics of open quantum systems (OQSs). Although it is usually claimed to be a concept inspired by classical Markovianity, the term quantum Markovianity is used inconsistently and often unrigorously in the literature. In this report we compare the descriptions of classical stochastic processes and quantum stochastic processes (as arising in OQSs), and show that there are inherent differences that lead to the non-trivial problem of characterizing quantum non-Markovianity. Rather than proposing a single definition of quantum Markovianity, we study a host of Markov-related concepts in the quantum regime. Some of these concepts have long been used in quantum theory, such as quantum white noise, factorization approximation, divisibility, and GKS\textendash{}Lindblad master equation. Others are first proposed in this report, including those we call past\textendash{}future independence, no (quantum) information backflow, and composability. All of these concepts are defined under a unified framework, which allows us to rigorously build hierarchy relations among them. With various examples, we argue that the current most often used definitions of quantum Markovianity in the literature do not fully capture the memoryless property of OQSs. In fact, quantum non-Markovianity is highly context-dependent. The results in this report, summarized as a hierarchy figure, bring clarity to the nature of quantum non-Markovianity. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Usually coherence is destroyed when a quantum system is in contact with the environment as part of the crossover between microscopic quantum effects and the macroscopic classical world. However, sometimes quantum coherence persists even in contact with an environment. A team led by Alexander Szameit from Universit{\"a}t Rostock have shown theoretically and experimentally that the quantum properties of identical particles realizes one such scenario. When a system has multiple indistinguishable particles, the wavefunction must be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange of particles. Szameit et al. demonstrate that, even in a device where a single particle is decohered by the environment, the additional correlations required by indistinguishability counter-intuitively lead to multi-particle steady states that preserve quantum coherence.},

  title = {Some Surface Effects in the Hydrodynamic Model Sf Metals},
  abstract = {Heuristic guidance to image and van der Waals potentials and to parts of the surface energy CT should be furnished by the continuum-hydrodynamic model for metallic electrons, with assigned plasma frequency wp and sound velocity p, with an impenetrable barrier at the surface, and neglecting relativistic retardation. But such uses of the model when p{$>$}O have been obscured in recent years by errors about: (i) the orthogonality relation between normal modes; (ii) the Coulomb potential, outside the medium, due to continuum (`bulk') modes; and (iii) the enumeration of modes, and the likely dependence of the wavenumber cutoff on system size. This review aims mainly to disencumber the proper heuristic functions of the model from such misconceptions, avoidable in the light of the classic papers by Bloch (1933)) Jensen (1937) and Samoilovich (1945).},

  abstract = {The quantum-thermodynamical properties of (quasi-normal) overdamped electromagnetic modes (eddy currents) are investigated in the context of the magnetic Casimir-Polder interaction. The role of the material response in terms of spatially local and nonlocal material models is clarified. In particular, the focus is set on the systems entropy and a detailed discussion of the applicability of the Nernst theorem. In specific circumstances the spatially local (Drude) model reveals an "entropy defect", while spatial dispersion leads to a more regular behavior. The aim of this study is to present a physical explanation of the different mechanism at work in terms of the role that eddy modes play in the determination of the zero-temperature entropy.},

The ability to manipulate the dielectric function of the sponge by varying its porosity is applied to the calculation of the Hamaker constant using Lifshitz theory and the near radiative heat transfer properties. By using an effective medium approximation the dielectric function of the mesoporous sponge is calculated. As the porosity increases, our calculations show that the Hamaker constant decreases significantly. This is also used to calculate the van der Waals force between a gold nanoparticle and a gold mesoporous sponge as a function of the porosity. Also, using the fluctuating electrodynamics formalism, the change in the local electromagnetic density of states in the near field is calculated. As an application, the near field radiative heat absorbed by a SiC nanoparticle at a fixed distance from a Au sponge is calculated for different values of the porosity. The maximum heat transfer is achieved for high porosities near a metal-insulator percolation transition.},

Coupling and field enhancement are the most prominent phenomena on corrugated surfaces and lead to numerous important applications. Attention has been focused on the explanation of the physics. To keep the text readable, sophisticated calculations have been avoided, and instead various applications dealing with enhanced light emission, nonlinear optics, SERS, and other cases of interest are discussed.},

  abstract = {In the work, the thermal and vacuum fluctuation is predicted capable of generating a Casimir thrust force on a rotating chiral particle, which will push or pull the particle along the rotation axis. The Casimir thrust force comes from two origins: i) the rotation-induced symmetry-breaking in the vacuum and thermal fluctuation and ii) the chiral cross-coupling between electric and magnetic fields and dipoles, which can convert the vacuum spin angular momentum (SAM) to the vacuum force. Using the fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT), we derive the analytical expressions for the vacuum thrust force in dipolar approximation and the dependences of the force on rotation frequency, temperature and material optical properties are investigated. The work reveals a new mechanism to generate a vacuum force, which opens a new way to exploit zero-point energy of vacuum.},

Recently, a redefinition of heat has been presented in [\textbackslash{}href\{Nature Communicationsvolume 8, Article number: 2180 (2017)\}\{Nat. Commun. 8, 2180 (2017)\}]. We are going to determine how this redefinition of heat could affect the expression of the entropy production. Utilizing this new definition of heat, it could be found out that there is a new expression for the entropy production for thermal operations. It could be derived if the initial state of the system and the bath is factorized, and if the total entropy of composite system is preserved, then the new entropy production will be equal to mutual information between the system and the bath. It is shown that if the initial state of the system is diagonal in energy bases, then the thermal operations cannot create a quantum correlation between the system and the bath.},

  title = {Classifying Transport Behavior via Current Fluctuations in Open Quantum Systems},
  abstract = {There are two standard ways of classifying transport behavior of systems. The first is via time scaling of spread of correlations in the isolated system in thermodynamic limit. The second is via system size scaling of conductance in the steady state of the open system. We show here that these correspond to taking the thermodynamic limit and the long time limit of the integrated equilibrium current-current correlations of the open system in different order. In general, the limits may not commute leading to a conflict between the two standard ways of transport classification. Nevertheless, the full information is contained in the equilibrium current-current correlations of the open system. We show this analytically by rigorously deriving the open-system current fluctuation dissipation relations (OCFDR) starting from an extremely general open quantum set-up and then carefully taking the proper limits. We test our theory numerically on the non-trivial example of the critical Aubry-Andr\{\textbackslash{}'e\}-Harper (AAH) model, where, it has been recently shown that, the two standard classifications indeed give different results. We find that both the total current autocorrelation and the long-range local current correlations of the open system in equilibrium show signatures of diffusive transport up to a time scale. This time scale grows as square of system size. Beyond this time scale a steady state value is reached. The steady state value is conductance, which shows sub-diffusive scaling with system size.},

Existence and uniqueness, boundedness and uniform continuity of the global positive solution of the proposed model have been established. The conditions for extinction and persistence of the system have been derived. In the investigation, it is found that environmental noise plays a vital role in extinction as well as in persistence. Our analytical derivations are justified through numerical simulations which show the reliability of the model from the ecological point of view.

Brief derivations for both the NHD model and the GNOR model are presented. The formulations of the HDG method are given, in which we introduce two hybrid variables living only on the skeleton of the mesh. The local field solutions are expressed in terms of the hybrid variables in each element. Two conservativity conditions are globally enforced to make the problem solvable and to guarantee the continuity of the tangential component of the electric field and the normal component of the current density. Numerical results show that the proposed HDG methods converge at optimal rate. We benchmark our implementation and demonstrate that the HDG method has the potential to solve complex nanophotonic problems.},

It is an intrinsically two-dimensional excitation whose electromagnetic field decays exponentially with distance from the surface. In the past, it was possible to study only the (far-field) scattered light produced by the interaction of surface polaritons with surface features. Only with the development of scanning near-field optical microscopy did it become possible to measure the surface polariton field directly in close proximity to the surface where the SPP exists. Here we overview the near-field studies of surface polaritons on randomly rough and nanostructured surfaces, theoretical models of SPP interaction with surface features, and SPP applications in novel photonic technologies. Surface polariton scattering, interference, backscattering, and localization will be discussed, as well as concepts of surface polariton optics and polaritonic crystals. Surface polaritons are finding an ever increasing number of applications in traditional domains of surface characterization and sensors as well as in newly emerging nano-photonic and optoelectronic technologies.},

In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law.},

They describe the statistical fluctuations in time-averaged properties of many-particle systems such as fluids driven to nonequilibrium states and provide some of the few analytical expressions that describe nonequilibrium states. Quantitative predictions on fluctuations in small systems that are monitored over short periods can also be made, and therefore the fluctuation theorems allow thermodynamic concepts to be extended to apply to finite systems.

  abstract = {Trapped atoms near nanophotonics form an exciting new platform for bottom-up synthesis of strongly interacting quantum matters. The ability to induce tunable long-range atom-atom interactions with photons presents a novel opportunity to explore many-body physics and quantum optics. Integrating cold atoms with nanophotonic platforms has so far been restricted to discrete, suspended structures of quasi-linear geometry. Single atom manipulation and direct imaging on nanostructures also remains elusive. Migrating cold atoms to a planar photonic geometry may offer a wide variety of quantum functionalities with engineered photonic transport and scalability. Here, by implementing a configurable optical tweezer array over a photonic circuit tailored for cold atom integration and control, we report trapping and high-fidelity imaging of single atoms directly on a planar photonic circuit. Using an optical conveyor belt formed by a moving optical lattice within a tweezer potential, we show that single atoms can be transported from a reservoir into close proximity of a photonic interface, potentially allowing for the synthesis of a defect-free atom-nanophotonic hybrid lattice. Our experimental platform can be integrated with generic planar photonic waveguides and resonators, promising a pathway towards on-chip many-body quantum optics and new applications in quantum technology.},

  abstract = {Non-Markovian quantum processes exhibit different memory effects when measured in different ways; an unambiguous characterization of memory length requires accounting for the sequence of instruments applied to probe the system dynamics. This instrument-specific notion of quantum Markov order displays stark differences to its classical counterpart. Here, we explore the structure of quantum stochastic processes with finite length memory in detail. We begin by examining a generalized collision model with memory, before framing this instance within the general theory. We detail the constraints that are placed on the underlying system-environment dynamics for a process to exhibit finite Markov order with respect to natural classes of probing instruments, including deterministic (unitary) operations and sequences of generalized quantum measurements with informationally-complete preparations. Lastly, we show how processes with vanishing quantum conditional mutual information form a special case of the theory. Throughout, we provide a number of representative, pedagogical examples to display the salient features of memory effects in quantum processes.},

We show that the combination of nonequilibrium dynamics, anomalous Doppler effect and spin-momentum locking of light mediates an intriguing interplay between the atom's translational and rotational degrees of freedom. This behavior deeply affects the drag force in a way that is reminiscent of classical rolling friction. Our fully non-Markovian and nonequilibrium description highlights counterintuitive features characterizing the atom's velocity-dependent rotational dynamics and determining the strength of the frictional force. These results prompt interesting directions for tuning the interaction and for investigating non-equilibrium dynamics as well as the properties of confined light.},

We show in this work that Umklapp scatterings are not necessarily resistive\textemdash{}no thermal resistance is induced if the projected momentum is conserved in the direction of heat flow. This distinction is especially important in anisotropic materials such as graphite and black phosphorous. By introducing a direction-dependent definition of normal and Umklapp scattering, we can model thermal transport in anisotropic materials using the Callaway model accurately. This accuracy is physically rooted in the improved description of mode-specific phonon dynamics. With the new definition, we predict that second sound might persist over much longer distances than previously expected.},

The environment usually consists of large number of degrees of freedom which are difficult to control, but some sophisticated schemes for reservoir engineering have been developed6. The control of open systems plays a decisive role, for example, in proposals for entanglement generation7,8,9 and dissipative quantum computation10, for the design of quantum memories11 and in quantum metrology12.

  abstract = {We show that the dynamics of any open quantum system that is initially correlated with its environment can be described by a set of \$d\^2\$ (or less) completely positive maps, where \$d\$ is the dimension of the system. Only one such map is required for the special case of no initial correlations. The same maps describe the dynamics of any system-environment state obtained from the initial state by a local operation on the system (and are related to the set of states to which the environment may be steered via such local operations). The reduction of the system dynamics to a set of completely positive maps allows known numerical and analytic tools for uncorrelated initial states to be applied to the general case of initially correlated states, and provides a natural approach to quantum Markovianity for this case. We show that this set of completely positive maps can be experimentally characterised using only local operations on the system, via a generalisation of noise spectroscopy protocols. As applications, we first consider the problem of retrodicting the dynamics of an open quantum system which is in an arbitrary state when it becomes accessible to the experimenter, and explore the conditions under which retrodiction is possible. Further, we introduce a related one-sided or limited-access tomography protocol for determining an arbitrary bipartite state, evolving under a sufficiently rich Hamiltonian, via local operations and measurements on just one component. We simulate this protocol for a physical model of particular relevance to nitrogen-vacancy centres, and in particular show how to reconstruct the density matrix of a set of three qubits, interacting via dipolar coupling and in the presence of local magnetic fields, by measuring and controlling only one of them.},

Both static and time-dependent density functional theory are presented in detail. Although the emphasis is on the development of the basic physical ideas and on a critical discussion of the most useful approximations, the formal derivation of the results is highly detailed and based on the simplest, most direct methods.},

Lett \{\textbackslash{}bf 120\}, 040401 (2018)] measured for the first time the gradient of the Casimir force between two gold spheres in vacuum at room temperature, and placed a bound on the magnitude of the deviation of the measured force from the proximity force approximation (PFA). The present work extends a previous theoretical analysis of this experiment [G. Bimonte, Phys. Rev. D \{\textbackslash{}bf 97\}, 085011 (2018)], by analyzing in detail how the magnitude of the deviation from PFA is affected by the inclusion or neglect of ohmic dissipation at zero frequency, a much debated issue in the current Casimir literature, which goes by the name of the Drude vs plasma controversy. We analyze as well the effect of connecting the plates to charge reservoirs, which is the standard configuration used in Casimir experiments. We describe a simple and effective decimation procedure, allowing for a faster computation of the Casimir force for large aspect ratios of the system.},

The ergodic theorems that follow from the master equations are discussed and the basic problem of how irreversibility arises is reviewed in the light of these recent developments. Formal linear response theory is summarized and the recent work on non-equilibrium open systems is discussed in some detail. Some special applications that illustrate the general theories are presented at the end of the article. Several topics have been omitted-there is no discussion of irreversible thermodynamics or other phenomenological theories, and the theory of thermodynamic Green's function is mentioned only briefly.

  abstract = {Manipulating Optical Topology
Phase transitions in solid-state systems are often associated with a drastic change in the properties of that system. For example, metal-to-insulator transition or magnetic-to-nonmagnetic states find wide application in memory storage technology. An exotic electronic phase transition is the Lifshitz transition, whereby the Fermi surface undergoes a change in topology and a drastic change in the electronic density of states. Krishnamoorthy et al. (p. 205) now show that the notion of such a phase transition can be carried over to the optical regime by the suitable design of a metamaterial structure. This effect could be used to control the interaction between light and matter.
Light-matter interactions can be controlled by manipulating the photonic environment. We uncovered an optical topological transition in strongly anisotropic metamaterials that results in a dramatic increase in the photon density of states\textemdash{}an effect that can be used to engineer this interaction. We describe a transition in the topology of the iso-frequency surface from a closed ellipsoid to an open hyperboloid by use of artificially nanostructured metamaterials. We show that this topological transition manifests itself in increased rates of spontaneous emission of emitters positioned near the metamaterial. Altering the topology of the iso-frequency surface by using metamaterials provides a fundamentally new route to manipulating light-matter interactions.
Metamaterials can undergo an optical analog of electronic phase transitions that impacts local light-matter interactions.

The investigation shows how sensitive the refractive index functions are to the O2 and N2 flow rates, and for which growth conditions the materials deposit homogeneously. It also allows conclusions to be drawn on the degree of amorphousness and roughness. To facilitate comparison of the materials deposited in this work with others, the index of refraction was also determined and provided for the near-IR and visible ranges of the spectrum. The results presented here should serve as a useful information base for designing optical coatings for the MIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In this paper, we study heat exchange in situations where the objects are confined by additional objects so that the dimensionality of heat flow is reduced. In particular, we compute the heat transfer for spherical point particles placed between two parallel plates. The presence of the plates can enhance or reduce the transfer compared to the free case and provides a slower power-law decay for large distance. We also compute the heat radiation of a sphere placed inside a spherical cavity, finding that it can be larger or smaller compared to the radiation of a free sphere. This radiation shows strong resonances as a function of the cavity's size. For example, the cooling rate of a nanosphere placed in a cavity varies by a factor of \$10\^5\$ between cavity radii \$ 2 \textbackslash{} \textbackslash{}mu \{\textbackslash{}rm m\} \$ and \$ 5 \textbackslash{} \textbackslash{}mu \{\textbackslash{}rm m\} \$.},

  abstract = {Entropy production plays a fundamental role in nonequilibrium thermodynamics to quantify the irreversibility of open systems. Its positivity can be ensured for a wide class of setups, but the entropy production rate can become negative sometimes. This is often taken as an indicator of non-Markovian dynamics. We make this link precise by showing under which conditions a negative entropy production rate implies non-Markovian dynamics and when it does not. This is established within a unified language for two setups: (i) the dynamics resulting from a coarse-grained description of a system in contact with a single heat bath described by a Markovian master equation and (ii) the classical Hamiltonian dynamics of a driven system, which is coupled arbitrary strongly to a single heat bath. The quantum version of the latter result is shown not to hold despite the fact that the integrated thermodynamic description is formally equivalent to the classical case. The instantaneous steady state of a non-Markovian dynamics plays an important element in our study. Our key contribution is to provide a consistent theoretical framework to study the finite-time thermodynamics of a large class of dynamics with a precise link to its non-Markovianity.},

At separations where the finite speed of light affects the interaction, it is called the Casimir force. Thermal motion determines the fundamental sensitivity limits of its measurement at room temperature, but several other systematic errors contribute uncertainty as well and become more significant in air relative to vacuum. Here we discuss the viability of several measurement techniques in air (force modulation, frequency modulation, and quasi-static deflection), characterize their sensitivity and accuracy by identifying several dominant sources of uncertainty, and compare the results to the fundamental sensitivity limits dictated by thermal motion and to the uncertainty inherent to calculations of the Casimir force. Finally, we explore prospects for mitigating the sources of uncertainty to enhance the range and accuracy of Casimir force measurements.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that the Unruh-DeWitt harmonic-oscillator detectors in (1+1) dimensions derivative-coupled with a massless scalar field can mimic the atom mirrors in free space. Without introducing the Dirichlet boundary condition to the field, the reflectivity of our detector/atom mirror is dynamically determined by the interaction of the detector's internal oscillator and the field. When the oscillator-field coupling is strong, a broad frequency range of the quantum field can be mostly reflected by the detector mirror at late times. Constructing a cavity model with two such detector mirrors, we can see how the quantum field inside the cavity evolves from a continuous to a quasi-discrete spectrum which gives a negative Casimir energy density at late times. In our numerical calculations, the Casimir energy density in the cavity does not converge until the UV cutoff is sufficiently large, with which the two internal oscillators are always separable.},

Here we propose a scheme capable of revealing non-classical features of the bacteria (quantum discord of light-bacteria correlations) without exact modelling of the organisms and their interactions with external world. The scheme puts the bacteria in a role of mediators of quantum entanglement between otherwise non-interacting probing light modes. We then propose a plausible model of this experiment, using recently achieved parameters, demonstrating the feasibility of the scheme. Within this model we find that the steady state entanglement between the probes, which does not depend on the initial conditions, is accompanied by entanglement between the probes and bacteria, and provides independent evidence of the strong coupling between them.},

Expressing the Casimir energy as a sum over round trips between plane and sphere, we find two distinct contributions to the correction. The first one results from the variation of the Mie reflection operator, calculated within the geometric optical WKB approximation, over the narrow Fourier interval associated to specular reflection at the vicinity of the point of closest approach on the spherical surface. The second contribution, accounting for roughly 90\% of the total correction, results from the modification of the geometric optical WKB Mie scattering amplitude due to diffraction. Our derivation provides a clear physical understanding of the nature of the PFA correction for spherical surfaces.},

As shown by Schwinger for the regime of weak coupling \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ between system and environment, \$T(E)\$ emerges from the saddle-point analysis that leads to the usual ensemble equivalence in the thermodynamic limit. By extending these ideas for finite \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$, we provide a consistent generalization of temperature \$T(E,\textbackslash{}gamma)\$ in strongly coupled systems and we illustrate its main features for the specific model of Quantum Brownian Motion where it leads to consistent microcanonical thermodynamics. Interestingly, while this \$T(E,\textbackslash{}gamma)\$ is a monotonically increasing function of the total energy \$E\$, its dependence with \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ is a purely quantum effect drastically different for Markovian and non-Markovian regimes},

  abstract = {Thermodynamics and information have intricate interrelations. Often thermodynamics is considered to be the logical premise to justify that information is physical - through Landauer's principle -, thereby also linking information and thermodynamics. This approach towards information has been instrumental to understand thermodynamics of logical and physical processes, both in the classical and quantum domain. In the present work, we formulate thermodynamics as an exclusive consequence of information conservation. The framework can be applied to the most general situations, beyond the traditional assumptions in thermodynamics: we allow systems and thermal baths to be quantum, of arbitrary sizes and possessing inter-system correlations. Here, systems and baths are not treated differently, rather both are considered on an equal footing. This leads us to introduce a "temperature"-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We rely on the fact that, for a fixed amount of information, measured by the von Neumann entropy, any system can be transformed to a state with the same entropy that possesses minimal energy. This state, known as a completely passive state, acquires Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical form with an intrinsic temperature. We introduce the notions of bound and free energy and use them to quantify heat and work, respectively. Guided by the principle of information conservation, we develop universal notions of equilibrium, heat and work, Landauer's principle and universal fundamental laws of thermodynamics. We demonstrate that the maximum efficiency of a quantum engine with a finite bath is in general lower than that of an ideal Carnot engine. We introduce a resource theoretic framework for our intrinsic temperature based thermodynamics, within which we address the problem of work extraction and state transformations. Finally, the framework is extended to multiple conserved quantities.},

The calculated VDOS are compared with experimental data, recently published for gold and silver nanoparticles of similar size, obtained through plasmon resonance Raman scattering. The best agreement between the calculated and measured VDOS's is obtained for the ICO morphology for both metal nanoparticles. These results indicate that most of the nanoparticles in the experimental samples should have icosahedral structures. The present study also shows that, as in the case of molecular systems and small clusters, vibrational spectroscopy of metal nanoparticles with few nanometers in size, together with theoretical calculations, are powerful tools for their structure determination.},

Time-dependent Hermitian density matrix of two arbitrary coupled quantum oscillators of arbitrary properties interacting with separate reservoirs is derived based on path integration. Temporal dynamics of spatial variances and covariances of the oscillators from any given time up to quasi-equilibrium steady states is studied. In a general case, it is shown that asymptotic spatial variances of two arbitrary oscillators and their covariances achieve stationary values in the long-time limit. A comparison of steady state characteristics of coupled oscillators with those predicted by the fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) is performed. It is shown that the larger the difference in masses and eigenfrequencies of coupled oscillators, the smaller are the deviations of stationary variances from those given by the FDT at fixed coupling strength and fixed difference in temperatures between thermal baths. In framework of the model of the bilinear interaction and Ohmic dissipation and at any oscillators' parameters the variances and covariances have divergent character at strong couplings.},

The field quantization is based on the source-quantity representation of the electromagnetic field in terms of the dyadic Green's tensor. For media with a nonlocal response, a description in terms of a complex conductivity tensor is employed. As an alternative description, we introduce the permittivity, permeability and magnetoelectric susceptibilities to obtain an explicitly dualityinvariant scheme. We find that duality invariance only holds as a continuous symmetry when nonreciprocal responses are allowed for.},

We show that the power dissipated into field excitations and the associated friction force depend on how the atom is boosted from being initially at rest to a configuration in which it is moving at constant velocity ( v ) parallel to the planar interface. In addition, we point out that there is a subtle cancellation between the one-photon and part of the two-photon dissipating power, resulting in a leading order contribution to the frictional power which goes as v 4 . These results are also confirmed by an alternative calculation of the average radiation force, which scales as v 3 .},

  abstract = {The dissipative properties of spatially nonlocal conductors are investigated in the context of quantum friction acting on an atom moving above a macroscopic body. The focus is on an extended version of the hydrodynamic model for the bulk material's electromagnetic response. It is shown that the standard hydrodynamic description is inadequate for describing the frictional force since it completely neglects Landau damping. The extended version of the model contains a frequency-dependent compressibility factor for the Fermi liquid and qualitatively resolves this issue. For a quantitative assessment, these results are contrasted with those obtained for the more fundamental Boltzmann-Mermin model. Since the latter is technically involved, the simplicity of the extended hydrodynamic model allows for an easier analysis of the impact of nonlocality on quantum friction for other (planar) geometries. This is illustrated with an example involving a thin slab.},

The formalism is supposed to keep track of possible classes of effect, leaving the computor only with the (very difficult) task of evaluating a specific set of correlation functions specified by the formalism. The ability of the formalism to track some aspects of the calculation in a systematic way saves a substantial amount of effort. The price one pays, if one lets the formalism do some of one's thinking, is that the formalism then constrains precisely which correlation functions you must calculate, perhaps demanding expressions that are not very easy to obtain [1].},

  volume = {88},
  issn = {0034-6861, 1539-0756},
  abstract = {The dynamical behavior of open quantum systems plays a key role in many applications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems, such as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in many-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum transport, quantum chemistry and quantum information. In close analogy to a classical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a noisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator in Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an irreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many applications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of genuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations. Here, recent results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are discussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition, to the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the quantification of memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series of examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system dynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new perspective for applications, namely to exploit a small open system as a quantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is interacting with. This article further explores the various physical sources of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured spectral densities, nonlocal correlations between environmental degrees of freedom and correlations in the initial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their local detection. Recent experiments on the detection, quantification and control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This book treats the central physical concepts and mathematical techniques used to investigate the dynamics of open quantum systems. To provide a self-contained presentation the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction into the foundations of quantum mechanics with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes and dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and in the theory of quantum Brownian motion are applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process and to the experimental observation of decohering Schrodinger cat states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics, such as Levy statistics in the laser cooling of atoms, and the damped Jaynes-Cummings model. The basic features of the non-Markovian quantum behaviour of open systems are examined on the basis of projection operator techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and discusses several examples from a unified perspective, e.g. non-local measurements and quantum teleportation. Influence functional and super-operator techniques are employed to study the density matrix theory in quantum electrodynamics and applications to the destruction of quantum coherence are presented. The text addresses graduate students and lecturers in physics and applied mathematics, as well as researchers with interests in fundamental questions in quantum mechanics and its applications. Many analytical methods and computer simulation techniques are developed and illustrated with the help of numerous specific examples. Only a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and of elementary concepts of probability theory is assumed.},

  abstract = {The quantum-to-classical transition is due to environment-induced decoherence, and it depicts how classical dynamics emerges from quantum systems. Previously, the quantum-to-classical transition has mainly been described with memory-less (Markovian) quantum processes. Here we study the complexity of the quantum-to-classical transition through general non-Markovian memory processes. That is, the influence of various reservoirs results in a given initial quantum state evolving into one of the following four scenarios: thermal state, thermal-like state, quantum steady state, or oscillating quantum nonstationary state. In the latter two scenarios, the system maintains partial or full quantum coherence due to the strong non-Markovian memory effect, so that in these cases, the quantum-to-classical transition never occurs. This unexpected new feature provides a new avenue for the development of future quantum technologies because the remaining quantum oscillations in steady states are decoherence-free.},

  abstract = {An earlier exact result (Phys. Rev. Lett.55 (1985), 2273) for the free energy of an oscillatordipole interacting with the radiation field is obtained using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A key feature of the earlier calculation, a remarkable formula for the free energy of the oscillator, is obtained in the form of a corresponding formula for the oscillator energy. This confirms, by a longer, more conventional proof, the earlier result. An advantage of this present method is that separate contributions to the energy can be isolated and discussed. Explicit, closed-form expressions are given and the high-temperature limit is discussed.},

The existence of a free interpretation parameter a is a necessity connected with the fact, that the diffusion coefficient D is an amalgam of two kinetic parameters, the period length and the sojourn time in a potential well, which in their turn depend on the microscopic parameters of the model. The results show that the Ito and the H{\"a}nggi\textendash{}Klimontovich interpretations correspond to a trap and barrier models respectively, and that the Fisk\textendash{}Stratonovich one corresponds to a modulation of the potential's period.

The rules of It{\^o} and Stratonovich differ, but both are mathematically consistent and therefore equally admissible conventions. The reason why they seem to lead to physical differences is that the Langevin approach used to arrive at the equation involves a tacit assumption. For systems with external noise this assumption can be justified, and it is then clear that the Stratonovich rule applies. Systems with internal noise, however, can only be properly described by a master equation and the It{\^o}-Stratonovich controversy never enters. Afterward one is free to model the resulting fluctuations either with an It{\^o} or a Stratonovich scheme, but that does not lead to any new information.},

  abstract = {A quantum twist on classical optics
Interpreting recent experimental results of light interactions with matter shows that the classical Maxwell theory of light has intrinsic quantum spin Hall effect properties even in free space. Complex effects in condensed-matter systems can often find analogs in cleaner optical systems. Bliokh et al. argue that the optical systems exhibiting such complex phenomena should also be simpler (see the Perspective by Stone). Their theoretical study shows that free-space light has a nonzero topological spin Chern number and thus should have counterpropagating surface modes. Such modes are actually well known and can be described as evanescent modes of Maxwell equations.
Science, this issue p. 1448; see also p. 1432
Maxwell's equations, formulated 150 years ago, ultimately describe properties of light, from classical electromagnetism to quantum and relativistic aspects. The latter ones result in remarkable geometric and topological phenomena related to the spin-1 massless nature of photons. By analyzing fundamental spin properties of Maxwell waves, we show that free-space light exhibits an intrinsic quantum spin Hall effect\textemdash{}surface modes with strong spin-momentum locking. These modes are evanescent waves that form, for example, surface plasmon-polaritons at vacuum-metal interfaces. Our findings illuminate the unusual transverse spin in evanescent waves and explain recent experiments that have demonstrated the transverse spin-direction locking in the excitation of surface optical modes. This deepens our understanding of Maxwell's theory, reveals analogies with topological insulators for electrons, and offers applications for robust spin-directional optical interfaces.
A theoretical study reveals that quantum effects may manifest in classical optical experiments. [Also see Perspective by Stone]

This paper proposes a modified structure with a dielectric film covered above the metal film of aforementioned structure, which can improve the radiation characteristics by its effective manipulation on the dispersion property of surface plasmon polaritons. The required exciting electron beam energy for generation of light radiation from visible to ultraviolet frequency regime is dramatically lowered. Furthermore, the radiation power density reaches several times that of the original one due to stronger confinement of surface plasmon polaritons on the metal film. The dependence of radiation characteristics including radiation frequency and power density on the permittivity and thickness of dielectric film are studied in detail. The lower exciting electron beam energy and higher radiation power density of the modified structure will facilitate the practical application of a coherent, tunable and compact integrated light radiation source.},

This paper proposes a modified structure with a dielectric film covered above the metal film of aforementioned structure, which can improve the radiation characteristics by its effective manipulation on the dispersion property of surface plasmon polaritons. The required exciting electron beam energy for generation of light radiation from visible to ultraviolet frequency regime is dramatically lowered. Furthermore, the radiation power density reaches several times that of the original one due to stronger confinement of surface plasmon polaritons on the metal film. The dependence of radiation characteristics including radiation frequency and power density on the permittivity and thickness of dielectric film are studied in detail. The lower exciting electron beam energy and higher radiation power density of the modified structure will facilitate the practical application of a coherent, tunable and compact integrated light radiation source.},

  abstract = {The basic features of the dynamics of open quantum systems, such as the dissipation of energy, the decay of coherences, the relaxation to an equilibrium or non-equilibrium stationary state, and the transport of excitations in complex structures are of central importance in many applications of quantum mechanics. The theoretical description, analysis and control of non-Markovian quantum processes play an important role in this context. While in a Markovian process an open system irretrievably loses information to its surroundings, non-Markovian processes feature a flow of information from the environment back to the open system, which implies the presence of memory effects and represents the key property of non-Markovian quantum behaviour. Here, we review recent ideas developing a general mathematical definition for non-Markovianity in the quantum regime and a measure for the degree of memory effects in the dynamics of open systems, which are based on the exchange of information between system and environment. We further study the dynamical effects induced by the presence of system\textendash{}environment correlations in the total initial state and design suitable methods to detect such correlations through local measurements on the open system.},

We derive the non-Markovian version of the Crooks fluctuation theorem that relates the statistical averages of the two different dynamics characterized by the forward process and the reverse process. In contrast to the similar study by Zamponi et al, ours does not assume a stationary state asymptotically in time so that the present fluctuation theorem can deal explicitly with the dependence of the initial condition and the transient behavior. The Jarzynski equality for the non-equilibrium work relation and the representation of the linear response in the non-equilibrium steady state are also discussed. The conditions for the memory kernel that the fluctuation theorems hold are examined by analyzing a solvable model and are confirmed by a direct derivation of the fluctuation theorems for the cases of an exponential decay and a power law decay of the memory kernel.},

The protocols we discuss are based on the blockade mechanism between atoms which, when excited to a Rydberg state, interact through a van der Waals potential, and rely on single-site addressing. Specifically, we discuss protocols for efficient creation of an antiferromagnetic GHZ state, a class of matrix product states including a so-called Rydberg crystal and for the state transport of a single-qubit quantum state between two ends of a chain of atoms. We identify system parameters allowing for the operation of the protocols on timescales shorter than the lifetime of the Rydberg states while yielding high fidelity output states. We discuss the effect of positional disorder on the resulting states and comment on limitations due to other sources of noise such as radiative decay of the Rydberg states. The proposed protocols provide a testbed for benchmarking the performance of quantum information processing platforms based on Rydberg atoms.},

As shown by Schwinger for the regime of weak coupling \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ between system and environment, \$T(E)\$ emerges from the saddle-point analysis leading to the ensemble equivalence up to corrections \$\{\textbackslash{}cal O\}(1/\textbackslash{}sqrt\{N\})\$ in the squared root of the inverse number of particles \$N\$ that defines the thermodynamic limit. By extending these ideas for finite \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$, while keeping \$N\textbackslash{}to \textbackslash{}infty\$, we provide a consistent generalization of temperature \$T(E,\textbackslash{}gamma)\$ in strongly coupled systems and we illustrate its main features for the specific model of Quantum Brownian Motion where it leads to consistent microcanonical thermodynamics. Interestingly, while this \$T(E,\textbackslash{}gamma)\$ is a monotonically increasing function of the total energy \$E\$, its dependence with \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ is a purely quantum effect drastically different for Markovian and non-Markovian regimes.},

However, if one also specifies that the potential A{$\mathrm{\mu}$} in such a theory transforms as a pseudovector rather than a vector, then the Hamiltonian becomes PT symmetric. The resulting non-Hermitian theory of electrodynamics is the analog of a spinless quantum field theory in which a pseudoscalar field {$\phi$} has a cubic self-interaction of the form i{$\phi$}3. The Hamiltonian for this cubic scalar field theory has a positive spectrum, and it has recently been demonstrated that the time evolution of this theory is unitary. The proof of unitarity requires the construction of a new operator called C, which is then used to define an inner product with respect to which the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint. In this Letter the corresponding C operator for nonHermitian quantum electrodynamics is constructed perturbatively. This construction demonstrates the unitarity of the theory. Non-Hermitian quantum electrodynamics is a particularly interesting quantum field theory model because it is asymptotically free.},

  abstract = {Controlling the electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors is a key asset for organic electronics, nowadays realized mostly by molecular dopants. Two doping mechanisms have been reported - chargetransfer complex (CTC) and ion pair (IPA) formation. However, their occurrence depending on molecular structure, energy levels, and structure of thin films remains elusive. Here, we study p-type doping of the planar organic semiconductor dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) in combination with the electron acceptors tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (TCNNQ) and hexafluorotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F6TCNNQ) as planar dopants. The conductivity of DBTTF films increases by more than two orders of magnitude upon doping with F6TCNNQ and only slightly with TCNNQ. The highest conductivity is reached at about 10 mol \% dopant concentration as a result of two counteracting effects: (1) increasing carrier concentration and (2) reduced carrier mobility due to the growing density of structural defects. We identified two different CTCs for DBTTF:TCNNQ blends and both types of charge-transfer interactions (CTC and IPA) in films of DBTTF doped with F6TCNNQ from absorption measurements. No signature of the charge-transfer interaction is found for DBTTF and TCNNQ in solution, whereas IPA formation only is observed for DBTTF and F6TCNNQ. Many-body perturbation theory calculations of the electronic and optical properties of one-dimensional stacks complement the experimental data and help in understanding the behavior of CTCs. The degree of charge transfer turns out to be higher for the DBTTF:F6TCNNQ complexes than for DBTTF:TCNNQ, as derived from the CN stretching mode softening in infrared absorption. We discuss the different fundamental semiconductor-dopant interactions in solution as compared to the solid state with the aid of the state-of-matter-dependent energy levels of the materials. The presence of both charge-transfer mechanisms in the material combinations investigated here gives us access to their doping efficiency, which is higher for IPA than for CTC formation. Avoiding the CTC formation by structural imperfections seems to be a way to increase the doping efficiency for crystalline materials. The determination of energy levels both in solution and in thin films is beneficial for understanding charge-transfer behavior.},

It offers a unified approach to QED in such media. Applying the quantization scheme, a theory of the dispersion forces on the basis of the Lorentz force is developed. By regarding the dispersion force as the (ground-state or thermal-state) expectation value of the Lorentz force that acts on appropriately defined charge and current densities, Casimir, Casimir-Polder, and van der Waals forces are united in a very natural way that makes transparent their common physical basis. Application of the theory to planar structures yields generalizations of well-known Lifschitz and Casimir-type formulas.},

Several forms for the bath spectral density are employed to compute zero phonon absorption line shapes.

Depending on the frequency, losses of collective excitations in metals can be predominantly classical resistive effects or Landau damping. In this context, we present firstprinciples calculations that capture all of the significant microscopic mechanisms underlying surface plasmon decay and predict the initial excited carrier distributions so generated. Specifically, we include ab initio predictions of phonon-assisted optical excitations in metals, which are critical to bridging the frequency range between resistive losses at low frequencies and direct interband transitions at high frequencies. In the commonly used plasmonic materials, gold, silver, copper, and aluminum, we find that resistive losses compete with phonon-assisted carrier generation below the interband threshold, but hot carrier generation via direct transitions dominates above threshold. Finally, we predict energy-dependent lifetimes and mean free paths of hot carriers, accounting for electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering, to provide insight toward transport of plasmonically generated carriers at the nanoscale.},

  title = {Study of {{Classical}} and {{Quantum Open Systems}}},
  abstract = {This thesis covers various aspects of open systems in classical and quantum mechanics. In the first part, we deal with classical systems. The bath-of-oscillators formalism is used to describe an open system, and the phenomenological Langevin equation is recovered. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from its corresponding Langevin equation. The Fokker-Planck equation for a particle in a periodic potential in the high-friction limit is solved using the continued-fraction method. The equilibrium and time-dependent solutions are obtained. Under strong periodic driving, we observe significant non-linear effects in the dynamical hysteresis loops. Shapiro steps appear in the time-average of the drift velocity curves. Similar study is carried out for a dipole in an electric field. In the second part of the thesis, we begin the study of open quantum systems by re-deriving the quantum master equation using perturbation theory. The master equation is then applied to the bath-of-oscillators model. The subtleties and approximations of the master equation are discussed. We then use the master equation to solve the damped harmonic oscillator. The equilibrium solution coincides with the canonical distribution. The steady state response to DC and AC forces is also studied. Driven systems are more challenging in quantum open systems, and we manage to solve the quantum master equation with the continued-fraction method. We obtain the frequency-dependent susceptibility curves, which exhibit typical absorption and dispersion profiles.},

When the system is, instead, only weakly chaotic (specifically, along longstanding metastable Quasi-Stationary States), nonergodicity (i.e., discrepant ensemble and time averages) is observed, and robust q-Gaussian attractors emerge, consistently with recently proved generalizations of the CLT.},

Using Heisenberg equations of motion, this leads to a generalized quantum Langevin equation (QLE) for the quantum system involving two quantities which encapsulate the properties of the heat bath. Applications include: atomic energy shifts in a blackbody radiation heat bath; solution of the problem of runaway solutions in QED; electrical circuits (resistively shunted Josephson barrier, microscopic tunnel junction, etc.); conductivity calculations (since the QLE gives a natural separation between dissipative and fluctuation forces); dissipative quantum tunneling; noise effects in gravitational wave detectors; anomalous diffusion; strongly driven quantum systems; decoherence phenomena; analysis of Unruh radiation and entropy for a dissipative system.},

The full dynamics, Brownian particle plus thermal reservoir, are assumed to be Hamiltonian. The derivation proceeds in three steps. First, we derive a closed stochastic integrodifferential equation for the dynamics of the Brownian particle, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). In the second step, we approximate the GLE by a finite-dimensional Markovian equation in an extended phase space. Finally, we use singular perturbation theory for Markov processes to derive the Langevin equation, under the assumption of rapidly decorrelating noise. This derivation provides a partial justification for the use of stochastic differential equations, in particular the Langevin equation, in the modeling of physical systems.},

  abstract = {The phenomenological approach to the Langevin equation breaks down for quantum systems. It is necessary to take into account explicitly an external bath, which causes the damping and fluctuations. The question then is whether there exists an autonomous equation of motion for the system itself, with or without a memory kernel. Some simple cases are listed and for one case the derivation of Langevin's equation is carried out. It is compared to the exact result, which leads to the following conclusions. The equation is true only to the lowest order in the interaction between system and bath. In general there is a memory kernel but in two special cases the damping reduces to a simple proportionality with a friction coefficient ("Ohmic case"). \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The real space transient diffusion coefficient is found to exceed its asymptotic Einstein value for most times in that regime.

By means of a continuous sequence of infinitesimal unitary transformations, we decouple the small quantum system that one is interested in from its thermodynamically large environment. This yields a trivial final transformed Hamiltonian. Dissipation enters through the observation that generically observables ?decay? completely under these unitary transformations, i.e. are completely transformed into other terms. As a nontrivial example the spin-boson model is discussed in some detail. For the super-Ohmic bath we obtain a very satisfactory description of short, intermediate and long time scales at small temperatures. This can be tested from the generalized Shiba-relation that is fulfilled within numerical errors.},

We derive an analytic condition for the existence of such repulsive force depending on the optical properties of the substrate. We also demonstrate the effect using realistic anisotropic metamaterial implementations of a substrate. The anisotropic metamaterial approach using metal\textendash{}dielectric and graphene\textendash{}dielectric multilayers provides a tuneable spectral range and a very broad bandwidth of electromagnetic repulsion forces, in contrast to isotropic substrates.},

  abstract = {The belief among investigators of the Casimir effect is that it is conservative and that the two interpretations as to the source of energy behind the Casimir effect are equivalent. In the first, the energy source is considered to be the zeropoint fields in the vacuum of space between the plates. In the second, the source is considered to come from the potential energy of atoms in the bulk matter making up the plates. The bulk matter interpretation will be trivially conservative because the plates comprise a closed system. The vacuum energy interpretation is not as clear. If the zero-point fields between the plates are static, the system will be closed and the forces will be conservative. However the fields may be a dynamic steady state in which case the system could be open and the forces not conservative. This paper examines a plausible but speculative extension of the vacuum centric proximity force approximation that incorporates the local geometry of non-parallel plates. This inclusion eliminates problems of local scale nonsensical distances between plates as well as some absurd results but introduces non-conservative forces. While only an experiment or more fundamental analytic approach can determine whether Casimir forces are conservative, the purpose of this paper is to merely raise the question.},

Moreover, we apply the general theory of multipole expansion to some specific physical problems. In those problems we identify the first terms of the series with the monopole, dipole and quadrupole terms in the generalized theory. We also propose a situation in which Podolsky theory can be experimentally tested.},

Im ersten Teil der Arbeit wird das hydordynamische Modell f{\"u}r Metalle unter Verwendung eines st{\"o}rungstheoretischen Ansatzes behandelt.

Chapter 2 presents a semi-classical account of multipole theory, in which the Barron-Gray gauge is used to derive multipole polarizabilities describing the induction of molecular moments by a harmonic plane wave. Aspects of symmetry are treated in Chapter 3 \textemdash{} space-time behaviour of tensors and physical properties of molecules and crystals. In Chapter 4, D(E,B) and H(E,B) are obtained for linear anisotropic media, yielding expressions for the material constants which are required to satisfy origin independence, the Post constraint, and certain symmetries but fail the first two. Despite these difficulties, the standard theory is used in Chapter 5 to derive a wave propagation equation; this is applied to explain various physical effects in transmission, two of which are also described in a scattering theory. Chapter 6 deals with the reflection of electromagnetic waves from an anisotropic medium. The reflected intensities violate origin independence, showing again the unphysical nature of existing multipole theory. In Chapter 7, the fields are transformed while leaving Maxwell's equations unchanged, from which new material constants are derived in Chapter 8 that meet the three requirements in Chapter 4. Chapter 9 applies the transformed expressions to transmission and reflection phenomena, confirming the results of Chapter 5, while yielding reflected intensities that satisfy space and time invariances.},

By considering examples, the influence of various factors like form, size, electric and magnetic properties, or intervening media on the forces is addressed. Since the approach based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics does not only apply to equilibrium systems, it can be used to investigate dynamical effects such as the temporal evolution of forces on arbitrarily excited atoms.},

This theory is quantized and the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in terms of a continuum of normal modes. It is found that the introduction of nonlocal response in the medium automatically regulates some previously divergent results, and we calculate a finite value for the intensity of the electromagnetic field at a fixed frequency within a homogeneous medium. To conclude we discuss the potential importance of spatial dispersion in taming the divergences that arise in calculations of Casimir-type effects.},

The basic issues were known to Gibbs. Boltzmann conducted a very public debate with Loschmidt and others without a satisfactory resolution. In recent decades there has been no real change in the situation. In 1993 we discovered a relation, subsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which gives an analytical expression for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical \textasciimacron{}uctuations in thermostatted dissipative non-equilibrium systems. The relation was derived heuristically and applied to the special case of dissipative non-equilibrium systems subject to constant energy `thermostatting'. These restrictions meant that the full importance of the Theorem was not immediately apparent. Within a few years, derivations of the Theorem were improved but it has only been in the last few of years that the generality of the Theorem has been appreciated. We now know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics can be derived assuming ergodicity at equilibrium, and causality. We take the assumption of causality to be axiomatic. It is causality which ultimately is responsible for breaking time reversal symmetry and which leads to the possibility of irreversible macroscopic behaviour.},

Experimental searches for EDMs have severely constrained the possible theories that describe the CP-violation.The fundamental physical theories put forward to describe the K0 system are described, and application to the calculation of EDMs of the electron, the neutron, atoms, and molecules is thoroughly reviewed. The theoretical description is embellished by a comprehensive review of the experimental seraches for EDMs, along with an overview of likely future experimental trends.The book represents the first complete and simultaneous description of both theoretical and experimental techniques related to the issues of EDMs. It is intended for advanced graduate students who want a solid introduction to the theoretical and experimental issues, and for workers in the field who want a comprehensive review and overview of current work.},

  title = {On the Electrodynamics of Moving Permanent Dipoles in External Electromagnetic Fields},
  abstract = {The classical theory of electrodynamics is built upon Maxwell's equations and the concepts of electromagnetic field, force, energy and momentum, which are intimately tied together by Poynting's theorem and the Lorentz force law. Whereas Maxwell's macroscopic equations relate the electric and magnetic fields to their material sources (i.e., charge, current, polarization and magnetization), Poynting's theorem governs the flow of electromagnetic energy and its exchange between fields and material media, while the Lorentz law regulates the back-and-forth transfer of momentum between the media and the fields. The close association of momentum with energy thus demands that the Poynting theorem and the Lorentz law remain consistent with each other, while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the conservation laws of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum. This paper shows how a consistent application of the aforementioned laws of electrodynamics to moving permanent dipoles (both electric and magnetic) brings into play the rest-mass of the dipoles. The rest mass must vary in response to external electromagnetic fields if the overall energy of the system is to be conserved. The physical basis for the inferred variations of the rest-mass appears to be an interference between the internal fields of the dipoles and the externally applied fields. We use two different formulations of the classical theory in which energy and momentum relate differently to the fields, yet we find identical behavior for the restmass in both formulations.},

  abstract = {We compare two methodsthe fluctuation formula and the application of an external electric fieldfor determining the static relative permittivity (static dielectric constant) from molecular simulations in the Ewald dielectric boundary conditions. We express both the systematic and statistical errors in terms of a dimensionless saturation (dielectric polarization reduced by its maximum) and show that both methods possess the same efficiency. Saturation in the fluctuation route depends on the number of particles and the permittivity of the surrounding medium, where a value of infinity (tinfoil) for the latter is usually reasonable but not necessarily optimum. Saturation in the external field route is easily controlled by the field intensity; hence, we develop an extrapolation scheme and apply it to several water models, specifically, nonpolarizable (SPC/E, TIP4P/2005, NE6) and polarizable (POL3, DC97, BK3). In addition, we discuss the Clausius-Mossotti approximation for the optical permittivity; this quantity is needed in the fluctuation formula for polarizable models.},

While the separate effects of these two boundaries are well understood, we demonstrate here that additional, unexpected features arise upon approaching the effective edge formed by their intersection. For this purpose, we focus on the classical semiinfinite Ising model with spin-flip dynamics evolving out of equilibrium at its critical point. Considering both subcritical and critical values of the coupling among surface spins, we present numerical evidence of a scaling regime with universal features which emerges upon approaching the spatio-temporal edge and we rationalise these findings within a field-theoretical approach.},

The use of statistical mechanics in this context has, in our opinion, some definite advantages, in comparison with the more conventional quantum electrodynamic description of media that involves the use of a refractive index. The statistical-mechanical description is physical and direct, and the oscillator model, in spite of its simplicity, is nevertheless able to elucidate the essentials of the Casimir friction. As is known, there are diverging opinions about this kind of friction in the literature. Our treatment elaborates upon, and extends, an earlier theory presented by us back in 1992. There we found a finite friction force at any finite temperature, whereas at zero temperature the model led to a zero force. As an additional development in the present paper we evaluate the energy dissipation making use of an exponential cutoff truncating the relative motion of the oscillators. For the dissipation we also establish a general expression that is not limited to the simple oscillator model.},

Therewith by use of energy dissipation the formalism becomes more manageable and transparent than in the conventional setting where uniform sliding motion is assumed from t = -{$\infty$} to t = +{$\infty$}. One avoids separating off a reversible interparticle force (independent of friction) from the total force. Moreover, the cases of temperatures T = 0 and finite T are treated on the same footing.

  abstract = {We calculate the frictional resistance experienced by an atom, modelled as a harmonic oscillator, moving with constant velocity u at a fixed distance {$\zeta$} outside and parallel to the surface of a Drude-modelled half-space. Our method applies in the nonrelativistic/nonretarded/electrostatic regime, where u is far below c, and u/{$\zeta$} is far below any important natural frequency of the atom or of the material. For a dissipative (e.g. for an ohmic) half-space and for the low values of u least unlikely to be of practical interest, this force is dominated by a term proportional to u/{$\zeta$} 8, found perturbatively to fourth order in the interaction between atom and half-space. It appears to depend rather sensitively on how line shapes are handled.},

We argue that this model describes a large spin in a ferromagnet. We find that some effects of the two heat baths partially cancel each other. This leads to unexpected features such as underdamped oscillations and long relaxation times in the strong coupling regime. Such a partial frustration of dissipation can be ascribed to the canonically conjugate character of position and momentum. We compare this model to the scenario where a single heat bath couples linearly to both the position and the momentum of the central oscillator. In that case less surprising behaviour occurs for strong coupling. The dynamical evolution of the quantum purity for a single and a double wave packet is also investigated.},

Plasmon physics is intriguing and its precise modelling proved to be challenging. In fact, plasmons are highly responsive to a multitude of factors, either intrinsic to the Au NPs or from the environment, and recently the need emerged for the correction of standard electromagnetic approaches with quantum effects. Applications related to plasmon absorption and scattering in Au NPs are impressively numerous, ranging from sensing to photothermal effects to cell imaging. Also, plasmon-enhanced phenomena are highly interesting for multiple purposes, including, for instance, Raman spectroscopy of nearby analytes, catalysis, or sunlight energy conversion. In addition, plasmon excitation is involved in a series of advanced physical processes such as non-linear optics, optical trapping, magneto-plasmonics, and optical activity. Here, we provide the general overview of the field and the background for appropriate modelling of the physical phenomena. Then, we report on the current state of the art and most recent applications of plasmon resonance in Au NPs.},

To shed light on this problem, we study transport in a clean quantum system: ultracold lithium-6 in a two-dimensional optical lattice, a testing ground for strong interaction physics in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We determine the diffusion constant by measuring the relaxation of an imposed density modulation and modeling its decay hydrodynamically. The diffusion constant is converted to a resistivity by using the Nernst-Einstein relation. That resistivity exhibits a linear temperature dependence and shows no evidence of saturation, two characteristic signatures of a bad metal. The techniques we developed in this study may be applied to measurements of other transport quantities, including the optical conductivity and thermopower.},

Existing theories of stationary plasma oscillations lead to a dispersion equation (2), involving an integration across a pole. It is here shown that this difficulty is of purely mathematical origin, and can be overcome by a proper treatment. This treatment leads to a complete set of stationary solutions, which are much more numerous than the usual plasma oscillations. In particular, their wave lengths and frequencies are not connected by a dispersion equation, but independently assume all real values. Special superpositions of these stationary solutions correspond to the usual plasma oscillations. They constitute slightly damped plane waves, which do obey the dispersion equation (2), the integral being interpreted as a Cauchy principal value. An arbitrary initial distribution behaves (after a short transient time) like a superposition of such waves, as far as the density is concerned.},

  abstract = {We study fluctuation-induced phenomena in systems out of thermal equilibrium, resulting from the stochastic nature of quantum and thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic currents and waves. Specifically, we study radiative heat transfer and Casimir forces by applying the scattering formalism that expresses results solely in terms of the classical scattering matrices of the objects. For example, we obtain exact formulas for the heat radiation emitted by long cylindrical objects, as well as for Casimir forces that arise between them. We apply our results to explore the dependence of these phenomena on size and material properties of cylinders. While the scattering formalism is very general and technically can be employed for arbitrary shapes, in practice it is very time-consuming to apply it to the most experimentally-relevant and complex case of objects at close proximity. We examine easier ways to compute the heat transfer in such case. In particular, we develop a small distance expansion for the heat transfer between gently curved objects, in terms of the ratio of distance to radius of curvature. This expansion allows us to rigorously justify the widely used approach of "proximity transfer approximation", and to quantify corrections to it in the limit of small separation. Moreover, we study the role of surface roughness, and show that it may change the distance dependence of the heat transfer as well as Casimir forces between curved objects at proximity. Finally, as an alternative approach we construct general Green-Kubo relations that connect radiative heat transfer, non-equilibrium Casimir forces and vacuum friction between arbitrary objects to fluctuations in equilibrium which may be easier to consider from the perspective of experiment and simulations.},

  title = {Velocity Dependence of the Quantum Friction Force on an Atom near a Dielectric Surface},
  abstract = {Different approaches to the problem of the "quantum friction" force F acting on an atom moving with velocity v{$<<$}c parallel to a dielectric surface have resulted in different predictions for the way in which F depends on v. For instance, Scheel and Buhmann [Phys. Rev. A 80, 042902 (2009)] and Barton [New J. Phys. 12, 113045 (2010)] and others find a force linear in v, while Intravaia, Behunin, and Dalvit [arXiv:1308.0712, 2013] and others find that the force varies as v\^3 to lowest order in v. We argue that the F proportional to v\^3 prediction results from an oversimplified treatment of the atom as a linear oscillator, and that F depends on v in just the way predicted by Scheel and Buhmann and Barton.},

  volume = {50},
  issn = {1751-8121},
  abstract = {Fermi's golden rule applies to a situation in which a single quantum state is coupled to a near-continuum. This `quasi-continuum coupling' structure results in a rate equation for the population of . Here we show that the coupling of a quantum system to the standard model of a thermal environment, a bath of harmonic oscillators, can be decomposed into a `cascade' made up of the quasi-continuum coupling structures of Fermi's golden rule. This clarifies the connection between the physics of the golden rule and that of a thermal bath, and provides a non-rigorous but physically intuitive derivation of the Markovian master equation directly from the former. The exact solution to the Hamiltonian of the golden rule, known as the Bixon\textendash{}Jortner model, generalized for an asymmetric spectrum, provides a window on how the evolution induced by the bath deviates from the master equation as one moves outside the Markovian regime. Our analysis also reveals the relationship between the oscillator bath and the `random matrix model' (RMT) of a thermal bath. We show that the cascade structure is the one essential difference between the two models, and the lack of it prevents the RMT from generating transition rates that are independent of the initial state of the system. We suggest that the cascade structure is one of the generic elements of thermalizing many-body systems.},

  abstract = {The performance characteristics of a heat rectifier and a heat pump are studied in a non-Markovian framework. The device is constructed from a molecule connected to a hot and cold reservoir. The heat baths are modelled using the stochastic surrogate Hamiltonian method. The molecule is modelled by an asymmetric double-well potential. Each well is semi-locally connected to a heat bath composed of spins. The dynamics are driven by a combined system\textendash{}bath Hamiltonian. The temperature of the baths is regulated by a secondary spin bath composed of identical spins in thermal equilibrium. A random swap operation exchange spins between the primary and secondary baths. The combined system is studied in various system\textendash{}bath coupling strengths. In all cases, the average heat current always flows from the hot towards the cold bath in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. The asymmetry of the double well generates a rectifying effect, meaning that when the left and right baths are exchanged the heat current follows the hot-to-cold direction. The heat current is larger when the high frequency is coupled to the hot bath. Adding an external driving field can reverse the transport direction. Such a refrigeration effect is modelled by a periodic driving field in resonance with the frequency difference of the two potential wells. A minimal driving amplitude is required to overcome the heat leak effect. In the strong driving regime the cooling power is non-monotonic with the system\textendash{}bath coupling.},

Taking this insight as a starting point, we study the thermodynamics of systems strongly coupled to thermal baths. First, we provide strong-coupling corrections to the second law applicable to general systems in three of its different readings: As a statement of maximal extractable work, on heat dissipation, and bound to the Carnot efficiency. These corrections become relevant for small quantum systems and vanish in first order in the interaction strength. We then move to the question of power of heat engines, obtaining a bound on the power enhancement due to strong coupling. Our results are exemplified on the paradigmatic non-Markovian quantum Brownian motion.},

Steady-state heat currents with weak and strong qubit-bath couplings are clearly unified. Within the two-terminal setup, the negative differential thermal conductance is unraveled with strong qubit-bath coupling and finite qubit splitting energy. The partially strong spin-boson interaction is sufficient to show the negative differential thermal conductance. Based on the three-terminal setup, in which two qubits are asymmetrically coupled to three thermal baths, a giant heat amplification factor is observed with strong qubit-bath coupling. Moreover, the strong interaction of either the left or right spin-boson coupling is able to exhibit the apparent heat amplification effect.},

  volume = {92},
  abstract = {The transition from weakly damped coherent motion to localization in the context of the spin-boson model has been the subject of numerous studies with distinct behavior depending on the form of the phonon-bath spectral density J({$\omega$}){$\propto\omega$}s. Sub-Ohmic (s{$<$}1) and Ohmic (s=1) spectral densities show a clear localization transition at zero temperature and zero bias, while for super-Ohmic (s{$>$}1) spectral densities this transition disappears. In this paper, we consider the influence of the phonon-bath spectral density on the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum dot with electron-phonon interactions described by the extended Holstein model. Using the reduced density matrix formalism combined with the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree approach, we investigate the dynamic response, the time scales for relaxation, as well as the existence of multiple long-lived solutions as the system-bath coupling changes from the sub- to the super-Ohmic cases. Bistability is shown to diminish for increasing powers of s similar to the spin-boson case. However, the physical mechanism and the dependence on the model parameters such as the typical bath frequency {$\omega$}c and the polaron shift {$\lambda$} are rather distinct.},

  abstract = {An approximation scheme is developed to compute Brownian motion according to the Langevin equation for a molecular system moving in a harmonic force field (corresponding to a quadratic potential energy surface) and characterized by one or more rigid internal fragments. This scheme, which relies on elements of the rotation translation block (RTB) method for computing vibrational normal modes of large molecules developed by Sanejouand and co-workers [Biopolymers 34, 759 (1994); Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 41, 1 (2000)], provides a natural and efficient way to freeze out the small amplitude, high frequency motions within each rigid fragment. The number of dynamical degrees of freedom in the problem is thereby reduced, often dramatically. To illustrate the method, the relaxation kinetics of the small membrane-bound ion channel protein gramicidin-A, subjected to an externally imposed impulse, is computed. The results obtained from all-atom dynamics are compared to those obtained using the RTB-Langevin dynamics approximation (treating eight indole moieties as internal rigid fragments): good agreement between the two treatments is found.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based on Langevin equation has been widely used in the study of structural, thermal properties of matter in different phases. Normally, the atomic dynamics are described by classical equations of motion and the effect of the environment is taken into account through the fluctuating and frictional forces. Generally, the nuclear quantum effects and their coupling to other degrees of freedom are difficult to include in an efficient way. This could be a serious limitation on its application to the study of dynamical properties of materials made from light elements, in the presence of external driving electrical or thermal fields. One example of such system is single molecule dynamics on metal surface, an important system that has received intense study in surface science. In this review, we summarize recent effort in extending the Langevin MD to include nuclear quantum effect and their coupling to flowing electrical current. We discuss its applications in the study of adsorbate dynamics on metal surface, current-induced dynamics in molecular junctions, and quantum thermal transport between different reservoirs.},

We give the improved, simple dielectric function for gold which accounts for the frequency dependence of the interband transitions over 1.8 eV and, in addition, for the finite size effects in gold nanoparticles. On that basis, we provide the improved characterization of the spectral performance of gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, we give the direct size dependence of the resonance frequencies and total damping rates of localized surface plasmons of gold nanoparticles (retardation effects are taken into full account) in diverse dielectric environments.

  volume = {12},
  issn = {1367-2630},
  abstract = {The most striking feature of quantum mechanics is the existence of superposition states, where an object appears to be in different situations at the same time. The existence of such states has been previously tested with small objects, such as atoms, ions, electrons and photons (Zoller et al 2005 Eur. Phys. J. D 36 203\textendash{}28), and even with molecules (Arndt et al 1999 Nature 401 680\textendash{}2). More recently, it has been shown that it is possible to create superpositions of collections of photons (Del{\'e}glise et al 2008 Nature 455 510\textendash{}14), atoms (Hammerer et al 2008 arXiv:0807.3358) or Cooper pairs (Friedman et al 2000 Nature 406 43\textendash{}6). Very recent progress in optomechanical systems may soon allow us to create superpositions of even larger objects, such as micro-sized mirrors or cantilevers (Marshall et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 130401; Kippenberg and Vahala 2008 Science 321 1172\textendash{}6; Marquardt and Girvin 2009 Physics 2 40; Favero and Karrai 2009 Nature Photon. 3 201\textendash{}5), and thus to test quantum mechanical phenomena at larger scales. Here we propose a method to cool down and create quantum superpositions of the motion of sub-wavelength, arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects trapped inside a high-finesse cavity at a very low pressure. Our method is ideally suited for the smallest living organisms, such as viruses, which survive under low-vacuum pressures (Rothschild and Mancinelli 2001 Nature 406 1092\textendash{}101) and optically behave as dielectric objects (Ashkin and Dziedzic 1987 Science 235 1517\textendash{}20). This opens up the possibility of testing the quantum nature of living organisms by creating quantum superposition states in very much the same spirit as the original Schr{\"o}dinger's cat `gedanken' paradigm (Schr{\"o}dinger 1935 Naturwissenschaften 23 807\textendash{}12, 823\textendash{}8, 844\textendash{}9). We anticipate that our paper will be a starting point for experimentally addressing fundamental questions, such as the role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics.},

To reach this regime, the coupling between these systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement generation between spatially separate systems, even in room-temperature environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere.},

Here, we use an optically levitated nanoparticle in ultrahigh vacuum to directly measure {$\Gamma$}recoil. By means of a phase-sensitive feedback scheme, we cool the harmonic motion of the nanoparticle from ambient to microkelvin temperatures and measure its reheating rate under the influence of the radiation field. The recoil heating rate is measured for different particle sizes and for different excitation powers, without the need for cavity optics or cryogenic environments. The measurements are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and provide valuable guidance for the realization of quantum ground-state cooling protocols and the measurement of ultrasmall forces.},

An external cavity may compensate for the lack of internal cycling transitions in dielectric objects and it may provide assistance in the cooling of their centre-of-mass state.

  shorttitle = {Evanescent Light Scattering},
  abstract = {In near-field optics the very concept of dipole is often used to represent either an elementary source or a scattering center. The most simple and widely used example is that of a small spherical particle whose polarizability is assumed to conform to the Clausius-Mossotti relation. While in conventional, far-field optics this approximation is known to be valid provided that the object is much smaller than the wavelength, its extension to near-field optics requires some precautions. Indeed, in the case of the scattering, by a spherical object, of an evanescent field generated, for instance, by total internal reflection or by a surface polariton, the strong-field gradient may increase the contribution to the polarizability of multipoles higher than the dipole. Such high-order multipoles are seldom considered in near-field optics because they complicate considerably any scattering calculation. In this paper we derive, for a spherical particle, the contributions of multipole orders up to the hexadecapole. This serves to illustrate the relative importance of each order. Moreover, within the framework of the coupled dipole method, we study, self-consistently, the problem of the scattering of an evanescent field by the sphere. We show that, with an initial field decreasing exponentially, the dipole approximation can be misleading.},

  abstract = {The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectral band of a gold or silver nanoparticle is observed to shift as a result of the near-field plasmonic field of another nanoparticle. The dependence of the observed shift on the interparticle distance is used as a ruler in biological systems and gave rise to a plasmonic ruler equation in which the fractional shift in the dipole resonance is found to decrease near exponentially with the interparticle separation in units of the particle size. The exponential decay length constant was observed to be consistent among a small range of nanoparticle sizes, shapes, and types of metal. The equation was derived from the observed results on disks and spherical nanoparticles and confirmed using results on a DNA conjugated nanosphere system. The aim of the present paper is to use electron beam lithography and DDA calculations to examine the constancy of the exponential decay length value in the plasmonic ruler equation on particle size and shape of a number of particles including nanoparticles of different symmetry and orientations. The results suggest that the exponent is almost independent of the size of the nanoparticle but very sensitive to the shape. A discussion of the nanoparticles most suitable for different applications in biological systems and a comparison of the plasmonic ruler with Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is mentioned.},

A number of suitably defined response functions play a basic role in the present approach, as these in conjunction with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem lead to electromagnetic field correlation functions, which describe physical effects such as lifetimes, frequency shifts of the excited states, dispersion forces, etc. The quantization of the electromagnetic field is only implicitly used. A large part of the present paper is devoted to the calculation of the response functions involving different geometries and various types of dielectrics. Both spatially dispersive and spatially nondispersive dielectrics are considered. The response functions are calculated using Maxwell's equations and the usual boundary conditions at the interface adjoining the two mediums. As a first application of the present approach, the black-body fluctuations in finite geometries and the influence of surfaces on its temporal and spatial coherence are studied. An interesting theorem is also proved which enables us to calculate the normally ordered (antinormally ordered) correlation functions from the symmetrized correlation functions.},

  issn = {0004-637X, 1538-4357},
  abstract = {The discrete-dipole approximation for computing scattering and absorption by particles, originally developed by Purcell and Pennypacker, is a general method for computing scattering and absorption by a particle of arbitrary shape. Anisotropic dielectric functions and radiative reaction corrections are incorporated into the formalism of this method. An iterative algorithm for obtaining numerical solutions is employed which, unlike algorithms presented previously, works well for arbitrary complex dielectric functions. Validity criteria for the discrete-dipole approximation are discussed, including the importance of magnetic dipole effects and surface granularity. Discrete-dipole results for `` spheres '' with up to V = 2320 dipoles are compared with exact Mie theory calculations for two cases of the complex refractive index: m = 1.7 + 0.1; and m = 3 + 4\textexclamdown; agreement is excellent within the expected domain of validity, although surface granularity limits the accuracy when the refractive index is large. The discrete dipole method is applied to examine the ultraviolet optical properties of particles composed of graphite, with its extremely anisotropic wavelength-dependent dielectric tensor. The optical properties of graphite spheres are computed, and compared to the usual ``i-f '' approximation based on Mie theory; it is found that the ``3-3'' approximation is surprisingly good, at least for the cases considered. Optical properties are computed for graphite cylinders with axial ratios ranging from 3:1 ``disks'' to 1.5:1 ``rods,'' and equivalent radii up to aeq = 200 {\^A}. The 3:1 disks produce an extinction feature significantly longward of 2175 A, and therefore can be ruled out as an appreciable component of the interstellar grain population. The 1.5:1 disks, and the 1.5:1 rods, produce an extinction feature which is similar enough to the observed 2175 {\^A} feature that such grains cannot be rejected as a possible source of the observed 2175 {\^A} feature. Cross sections for linear and circular dichroism have been computed; the 1.5:1 disks and the 1.5:1 rods have quite distinct polarization ``signatures.'' If the 2175 {\^A} extinction feature is due to graphite particles, and these particles are partially aligned, then observations of linear and circular polarization in the ultraviolet can be used to determine the particle shape.},

Eine Verst{\"a}rkung der Schwingungssatelliten um drei Gr{\"o}{\ss}enordnungen ist auf effiziente Absorption und Emission durch die MNP zur{\"u}ckzuf{\"u}hren. Dann wird ein System aus einer molekularen Kette mit einem Gold-MNP untersucht. Alle zuvor genannten Ph{\"a}nomene treten auch hier auf, jedoch werden die Schwingungssatelliten durch das Exzitonenband der molekularen Kette ersetzt. Anschlie{\ss}end wird ein Nano-Laser aus vielen Molek{\"u}len und einem Gold-MNP betrachtet. Die Molek{\"u}le werden durch inkoh{\"a}rentes optisches Pumpen angeregt. Dabei wird eine starke Plasmonanregung durch die gemeinsame Kopplung an die Molek{\"u}le erreicht. Die Photonenemission des Lasers zeigt, dass die Intensit{\"a}t ansteigt, w{\"a}hrend die Linienbreite schmaler wird. Die Korrelationsfunktion in zweiter Ordnung f{\"u}r die Photonen in Verbindung mit der schmaler Emission k{\"o}nnte dabei sogar einen Hinweis auf Lasing geben. Zuletzt wird eine Nanoverbindung aus einem Molek{\"u}l und zwei sph{\"a}rischen metallischen Elektroden betrachtet. Das Molek{\"u}l wird durch den sequentiellen Ladungstransfer angeregt. Durch die Kopplung an die Molek{\"u}le werden die Elektrodenplasmonen angeregt. Die Photonenemission der Verbindung zeigt, dass die scharfen molekularen Schwingungssatelliten um das Tausendfache verst{\"a}rkt werden. Anschlie{\ss}end ist ein System aus zwei pyramidalen Elektroden, die seitlich von zwei Gold-MNP eingeschlossen werden, untersucht. Hier k{\"o}nnen die Schwingungssatelliten einzeln verst{\"a}rkt werden, indem der Abstand zwischen den MNP variiert wird. Wir zeigen auch, dass das Lasing in einer Verbindung aus vielen Molek{\"u}len theoretisch m{\"o}glich ist.},

  copyright = {2014 Nature Publishing Group},
  issn = {2041-1723},
  abstract = {Light can exert radiation pressure on any object it encounters and that resulting optical force can be used to manipulate particles. It is commonly assumed that light should move a particle forward and indeed an incident plane wave with a photon momentum {$\Elzxh$}k can only push any particle, independent of its properties, in the direction of k. Here we demonstrate, using full-wave simulations, that an anomalous lateral force can be induced in a direction perpendicular to that of the incident photon momentum if a chiral particle is placed above a substrate that does not break any left\textendash{}right symmetry. Analytical theory shows that the lateral force emerges from the coupling between structural chirality (the handedness of the chiral particle) and the light reflected from the substrate surface. Such coupling induces a sideway force that pushes chiral particles with opposite handedness in opposite directions.},

Deviations of individual particles from this value are interpreted as being due to variations in the local nanoenvironment.

  abstract = {To arrive at a clear and atomically realistic representation of the process of ionic screening, a model with the following necessary and justifiable constraints was devised. 1) The minimum internuclear distance (IND) between a negative site on the membrane and a cation screening the site is equal to the sum of the site's "equivalent" radius (rs) + the diameter of a water molecule (approximately 2.8 A) + crystal radius of the cation (rc). 2) The average value for the dielectric constant (D) over IND is given by D approximately 80 ((IND - rs - rc)/IND). When this simple atomic model for ionic screening is employed in conjunction with equilibrium ion-selectivity theory, it is possible to predict quantitatively, from coulombic energy calculations, the secondary stereospecific actions of certain alkaline-earth cations as well as the predominant screening effect of these divalent cations at the surfaces of different types of membranes. The model also successfully predicts the transition from a predominantly screening situation to a predominantly binding situation, which was observed experimentally when negative surface charge density was decreased in nerve.},

The aim of this paper is to give a didactic introduction how the conduction electrons in solids responds to an external time dependent electric field and to make a comparison between Drude and Lindhard dielectric function models for the electron gas. In within framework of Lindhard model we derived an expression for dielectric function that is similar to the familiar Drudes's formula.

We consider the particle to follow a classical, macroscopically-fixed trajectory and by integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of the plate we may calculate friction effects. We find a velocity dependance in the correction to the unitary geometric phase due to quantum frictional effects.

  abstract = {A velocity spectrometer for a neutral atomic beam has been developed to prepare a monovelocity atomic beam. In order to disperse a relatively fast atomic beam according to its longitudinal velocity, a magnetic quadrupole lens with a large magnetic gradient has been used. The device was made using NdFeB permanent magnets. The magnetic gradient in the quadrupole was measured to be sufficiently large (1 T/cm) and uniform along the radial direction. The resonance fluorescence spectra of the Li atomic beam after passing through the magnetic quadrupole lens have been measured by using a single-mode tunable laser. From the peak shift of the fluorescence spectrum, the exerted force on Li atoms by the magnetic lens was 8160 times as large as the acceleration of gravity. Using the present spectrometer, we have measured the longitudinal velocity distribution of the thermal Li beam at 800 {$\smwhtcircle$}C, which was in good agreement with the result from the fluorescence spectra. It is expected that a monovelocity Li atomic beam of 1000 m/s with a velocity spread narrower than 1\% can be easily formed with a compact experimental arrangement using the developed velocity spectrometer. In this case, the available flux given as a fraction of the incident Li flux is estimated to be about 1\%. A high-velocity resolution of 0.03\% is expected at the available fractional flux of about 0.01\%.},

Isolated atoms can exhibit wavelike (coherent) behavior with a corresponding de Broglie wavelength and phase which can be affected by nearby surfaces. Here an atom interferometer is used to measure the phase shift of Na atom waves induced by the walls of a 50 nm wide cavity. To our knowledge this is the first direct measurement of the de Broglie wave phase shift caused by atom-surface interactions. The magnitude of the phase shift is in agreement with that predicted by Lifshitz theory for a nonretarded van der Waals interaction.

We discuss recent generalizations of that theory, that include higher multipole polarizabilities, and present a list of additional effects, that may become important in future Casimir-Polder experiments. Among the latter, we see great potential for spectroscopic techniques, atom interferometry, and the manipulation of ultra-cold quantum matter (e.g. BEC) near surfaces. We address approaches based on quantum reflection and discuss the atomic beam spin-echo experiment as a particular example. Finally, some of the advantages of Casimir-Polder techniques in comparison to Casimir force measurements between macroscopic bodies are presented.},

Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories: (i) fundamental quantum science, (ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics.

The energy and mass dependence of the phase shifts that are due to rotation and acceleration are different. Thus a pair of interferometers with different energies and/or masses can perform simultaneous independent measurements of rotation and acceleration. A proposed configuration is one formed by a sequence of planar diffraction gratings operating in high order. Gratings consist of near-resonant standing-wave laser beams. Laser decelerated and cooled atomic beams provide a suitable source. Path curvature due to acceleration and rotation is canceled by magnetic field gradients that produce an effective magnetic levitation of the atoms in a feedback arrangement that maintains null phase shift.},

  abstract = {In atom optics a material structure is commonly regarded as an amplitude mask for atom waves. However, atomic diffraction patterns formed using material gratings indicate that material structures also operate as phase masks. In this study a well collimated beam of sodium atoms is used to illuminate a silicon nitride grating with a period of 100 nm. During passage through the grating slots atoms acquire a phase shift due to the van der Waals (vdW) interaction with the grating walls. As a result the relative intensities of the matter-wave diffraction peaks deviate from those expected for a purely absorbing grating. Thus a complex transmission function is required to explain the observed diffraction envelopes. An optics perspective to the theory of atomic diffraction from material gratings is put forth in the hopes of providing a more intuitive picture concerning the influence of the vdW potential. The van der Waals coefficient C3=2.7{$\pm$}0.8meVnm3 is determined by fitting a modified Fresnel optical theory to the experimental data. This value of C3 is consistent with a van der Waals interaction between atomic sodium and a silicon nitride surface.},

  abstract = {Matter-wave interferometry has become an essential tool in studies on the foundations of quantum physics1 and for precision measurements2,3,4,5,6. Mechanical gratings have played an important role as coherent beamsplitters for atoms7, molecules and clusters8,9, because the basic diffraction mechanism is the same for all particles. However, polarizable objects may experience van der Waals shifts when they pass the grating walls10,11, and the undesired dephasing may prevent interferometry with massive objects12. Here, we explore how to minimize this perturbation by reducing the thickness of the diffraction mask to its ultimate physical limit, that is, the thickness of a single atom. We have fabricated diffraction masks in single-layer and bilayer graphene as well as in a 1 nm thin carbonaceous biphenyl membrane. We identify conditions to transform an array of single-layer graphene nanoribbons into a grating of carbon nanoscrolls. We show that all these ultrathin nanomasks can be used for high-contrast quantum diffraction of massive molecules. They can be seen as a nanomechanical answer to the question debated by Bohr and Einstein13 of whether a softly suspended double slit would destroy quantum interference. In agreement with Bohr's reasoning we show that quantum coherence prevails, even in the limit of atomically thin gratings.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the temporal evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems has long been elusive. Recently, meaningful experimental studies1,2 of the problem have become possible, stimulating theoretical interest3,4,5,6,7. In generic isolated systems, non-equilibrium dynamics is expected8,9 to result in thermalization: a relaxation to states in which the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable using statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible10. For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, in which the time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete11. Some recent studies4,5 even suggest that statistical mechanics may give incorrect predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that a generic isolated quantum many-body system does relax to a state well described by the standard statistical-mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation, and that thermalization instead happens at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by Deutsch12 and Srednicki13. A striking consequence of this eigenstate-thermalization scenario, confirmed for our system, is that knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate is sufficient to compute thermal averages\textemdash{}any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, because they all give the same result.},

  issn = {1751-8121},
  abstract = {Casimir friction between a polarizable particle and a semi-infinite space is a delicate physical phenomenon, as it concerns the interaction between a microscopic quantum particle and a semi-infinite reservoir. Not unexpectedly, results obtained in the past about the friction force obtained via different routes are sometimes, at least apparently, wildly different from each other. Recently, we considered the Casimir friction force for two dielectric semi-infinite plates moving parallel to each other H{\o}ye and Brevik (2014 Eur. Phys. J. D 68 61), and managed to get essential agreement with results obtained by Pendry (1997 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 9 10301), Volokitin and Persson (2007 Rev. Mod. Phys. 79 1291), and Barton (2011 New J. Phys. 13 043023; 2011 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 23 335004). Our method was based upon use of the Kubo formalism. In the present paper we focus on the interaction between a polarizable particle and a dielectric half-space again, and calculate the friction force using the same basic method as before. The new ingredient in the present analysis is that we take into account radiative damping, and derive the modifications thereof. Some comparisons are also made with works from others. Essential agreement with the results of Intravaia, Behunin, and Dalvit can also be achieved using the modification of the atomic polarizability by the metallic plate.},

The (photon-pair) emission probabilities, the radiative reaction force, and the radiated power are determined for a half-space with arbitraryv. For simple-harmonicvthe single-photon spectrum and angular distribution are given explicitly. The drag exerted on a fixed half-space by a moving one vanishes for constantv, although no reason from any symmetry is apparent. Ifa{$\Omega$}/c{$\NestedGreaterGreater$}1, then a sphere of radiusaoscillating harmonically at frequency{$\Omega$}radiates power at the same rate per unit area of its surface as would a half-space with the same velocity; but ifa{$\Omega$}/c{$\NestedLessLess$}1, the power is less by a factor (a{$\Omega$}/c)6, a measure of the difference between effectively infinite and finite-size mirrors. An appendix evaluates the finite-temperature reaction and drag forces at constantv. Remarkably, this drag on a fixed half-space is independent of its distance from the moving one.},

We integrate out the damped polaritons by using diagrammatic techniques and find an exact expression for the displacement-field (photon) propagator in the presence of a dispersive and absorbing dielectric half-space. This offers a route to traceable perturbative calculations of the same kind as in free-space quantum electrodynamics. As a worked-through example, we consider the interaction of a neutral atom with a dispersive and absorbing dielectric half-space. For that, we use the multipolar coupling {$\mu\cdot$}D of the atomic dipole moment to the electromagnetic displacement field. We apply this formalism to calculate the one-loop correction to the atomic electron propagator and to find the energy-level shift and changes in the spontaneous decay rates for a neutral atom close to an absorptive dielectric mirror.},

  title = {Quantum Elecrodynamics near Material Boundaries},
  abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics in free-space is a well-understood and a very successful theory. This is not the case when polarizable boundaries are present, which is a common scenario. The presence of reflective surfaces affects the photon field. Thereby the quantummechanical vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are constrained leading to changes in the interaction energies of charged particles which are directly measurable. One of the most famous examples of such an effect is the Lamb shift of an atom in front of a perfectly reflecting mirror, which depends on the distance of the atom from the mirror, thus giving rise to an attractive force - the so-called Casimir-Polder force. This thesis touches upon current challenges of quantum electrodynamics with externally applied boundary conditions, which is of increasing importance for nanotechnology and its applications in physics, chemistry and biology. When studying the abovementioned vacuum effects one can use models of various degrees of sophistication for the material properties that need to be taken into account. The simplest is to assume perfect reflectivity. This leads to simple boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field and thereby its quantum fluctuations. The difficulty of such calculations then lies only in the possibly complex geometry of the macroscopic body. The next possible level of sophistication is to allow imperfect reflectivity. The simplest way to achieve this is by considering a material with constant and frequency-independent refractive index. However, for all real material surfaces the reflectivity is frequency-dependent. Causality then requires that dispersion is accompanied by absorption. The aim of this project was twofold: (i) to construct, using well-understood tools of theoretical physics, the microscopic theory of quantum systems, like atoms, interacting with macroscopic polarizable media, which would facilitate relatively simple perturbative calculations of QED corrections due to the presence of boundaries, (ii) to apply the developed formalism to the calculation of the Casimir-Polder force between an atom and a realistic material.},

  abstract = {Fermi's golden rule applies to a situation in which a single quantum state |{$\psi$} is coupled to a near-continuum. This `quasi-continuum coupling' structure results in a rate equation for the population of |{$\psi$} . Here we show that the coupling of a quantum system to the standard model of a thermal environment, a bath of harmonic oscillators, can be decomposed into a `cascade' made up of the quasi-continuum coupling structures of Fermi's golden rule. This clarifies the connection between the physics of the golden rule and that of a thermal bath, and provides a non-rigorous but physically intuitive derivation of the Markovian master equation directly from the former. The exact solution to the Hamiltonian of the golden rule, known as the Bixon\textendash{}Jortner model, generalized for an asymmetric spectrum, provides a window on how the evolution induced by the bath deviates from the master equation as one moves outside the Markovian regime. Our analysis also reveals the relationship between the oscillator bath and the `random matrix model' (RMT) of a thermal bath. We show that the cascade structure is the one essential difference between the two models, and the lack of it prevents the RMT from generating transition rates that are independent of the initial state of the system. We suggest that the cascade structure is one of the generic elements of thermalizing many-body systems.},

  abstract = {The reformulation of the standard golden rule approach considered in this paper for treating reactive tunneling reduces the computation of the reaction rate to a derivation of band shapes for energy levels of reactant and product states. This treatment is based on the assumption that the medium environment is actively involved as a partner in the energy exchange with the reactive subsystem but its reorganization effect is negligible. Starting from the quantum relaxation equation for the density matrix, the required band shapes are represented in terms of the spectral density function, exhibiting the continuum spectrum inherent to the interaction between the reactants and the medium in the total reactive system. The simplest Lorentzian spectral bands, obtained under Redfield approximation, proved to be unsatisfactory because they produced a divergent rate expression at low temperature. The problem is resolved by invoking a refined spectral band shape, which behaves as Lorentzian one at the band center but decays exponentially at its tails. The corresponding closed non-Markovian rate expression is derived and investigated taking as an example the photochemical H-transfer reaction between fluorene and acridine proceeding in the fluorene molecular crystal. The kinetics in this reactive system was thoroughly studied experimentally in a wide temperature range [B. Prass et al., Ber. Bunsenges. Phys. Chem. 102, 498 (1998)].},

  abstract = {.The Casimir friction problem can be dealt with in a simplified way by considering two harmonic oscillators moving with constant relative velocity. Recently we calculated the energy dissipation {$\Delta$}E for such a case [Europhys. Lett. 91, 60003 (2010); Eur. Phys. J. D 61, 335 (2011)]. A recent study of Barton [New J. Phys. 12, 113044 (2010)] seemingly leads to a different result for the dissipation. If such a discrepancy really were true, it would imply a delicate difficulty for the basic theory of Casimir friction. In the present note we show that the expressions for {$\Delta$}E are in fact physically equivalent, at T = 0.},

  abstract = {In a colloidal suspension at equilibrium, the diffusive motion of a tracer particle due to random thermal fluctuations from the solvent is related to the particle's response to an applied external force, provided this force is weak compared to the thermal restoring forces in the solvent. This is known as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) and is expressed via the Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland (SES) relation D = kBT/{$\zeta$}, where D is the particle's self-diffusivity (fluctuation), {$\zeta$} is the drag on the particle (dissipation), and kBT is the thermal Boltzmann energy. Active suspensions are widely studied precisely because they are far from equilibrium\textemdash{}they can generate significant nonthermal internal stresses, which can break the detailed balance and time-reversal symmetry\textemdash{}and thus cannot be assumed to obey the FDT a priori. We derive a general relationship between diffusivity and mobility in generic colloidal suspensions (not restricted to near equilibrium) using generalized Taylor dispersion theory and derive specific conditions on particle motion required for the FDT to hold. Even in the simplest system of active Brownian particles (ABPs), these conditions may not be satisfied. Nevertheless, it is still possible to quantify deviations from the FDT and express them in terms of an effective SES relation that accounts for the ABPs conversion of chemical into kinetic energy.},

This simple model system evidently can provide insight into more sophisticated processes, such as particle production in cosmological models and exploding black holes. In spite of the conformally static nature of the problem, the vacuum expectation value of the tensor for an arbitrary mirror trajectory exhibits a non-vanishing radiation flux (which may be readily computed). The expectation value of the instantaneous energy flux is negative when the proper acceleration of the mirror is increasing, but the total energy radiated during a bounded mirror motion is positive. A uniformly accelerating mirror does not radiate; however, our quantization does not coincide with the treatment of that system as a `static universe'. The calculation of the expectation value requires a regularization procedure of covariant separation of points (in products of field operators) along time-like geodesics; more na{\"i}ve methods do not yield the same answers. A striking example involving two mirrors clarifies the significance of the conformal anomaly.},

In turn, this deeply affects the drag force in a way that is reminiscent of classical rolling friction.

For simple metal surfaces we introduce a dispersed surface plasmon-pole approximation to the response function. The van der Waals energy calculated with this response function reproduces the asymptotic coefficient C3 and effective image-plane position ZvdW calculated by Zaremba and Kohn, and is also finite at all atom-surface separations unlike the usual asymptotic series approach. Using this van der Waals energy we calculate the binding energies of helium on simple metal surfaces.

Because of this imaginary part, the van der Waals potential can give rise to inelastic processes in atom-surface scattering, for example excitation of electron-hole pairs or surface plasmons. Using a self-energy formulation of the complex van der Waals interaction we derive expressions for inelastic scattering probabilities of atoms or ions reflected from surfaces. In the case of ion or electron scattering from surfaces this reproduces a well-known result. We calculate the probabilities for inelastic scattering of neutral xenon atoms incident on metal surfaces at hyperthermal energies. A comparison of our results with the recent experimental measurements of electron-hole pair excitation for hyperthermal xenon scattering by Amirav and Cardillo shows that this long-range van der Waals coupling is only a small contribution to the total electron-hole pair excitation probability, which is mostly due to thermal excitation.},

  abstract = {Surface energies are commonly used to determine the adhesion forces between materials. However, the component of surface energy derived from long-range forces, such as van der Waals forces, depends on the material's structure below the outermost atomic layers. Previous theoretical results and indirect experimental evidence suggest that the van der Waals energies of subsurface layers will influence interfacial adhesion forces. We discovered that nanometre-scale differences in the oxide layer thickness of silicon wafers result in significant macroscale differences in the adhesion of isolated gecko setal arrays. Si/SiO2 bilayer materials exhibited stronger adhesion when the SiO2 layer is thin (approx. 2 nm). To further explore how layered materials influence adhesion, we functionalized similar substrates with an octadecyltrichlorosilane monolayer and again identified a significant influence of the SiO2 layer thickness on adhesion. Our theoretical calculations describe how variation in the SiO2 layer thickness produces differences in the van der Waals interaction potential, and these differences are reflected in the adhesion mechanics. Setal arrays used as tribological probes provide the first empirical evidence that the `subsurface energy' of inhomogeneous materials influences the macroscopic surface forces.},

We demonstrate that the adhesion of micromachined surfaces is in a regime not considered by standard rough surface adhesion models. At small roughness values, our experiments and models show unambiguously that the adhesion is mainly due to van der Waals dispersion forces acting across extensive non-contacting areas and that it is related to 1/Dave2, where Dave is the average surface separation. These contributions must be considered because of the close proximity of the surfaces, which is a result of the planar deposition technology. At large roughness values, van der Waals forces at contacting asperities become the dominating contributor to the adhesion. In this regime our model calculations converge with standard models in which the real contact area determines the adhesion. We further suggest that topographic correlations between the upper and lower surfaces must be considered to understand adhesion completely.},

These forces of attraction must be overcome in order to disperse pigment particles in liquid media. Dispersion machinery is designed to generate the energy required to overcome these forces of attraction. But, as a result of the presence of adhesion and cohesion within the dispersion system, the efficiency of the dispersion operation is dependent significantly on the effectiveness of the transfer of energy from the dispersion equipment to the oversized pigment particles. This paper explores, from a practical point of view, the nature and significance of the various forces between the pigment particles and the adhesion and cohesion phenomena associated with pigment dispersion. Also, the principles relevant to the improvement of the efficiency of pigment dispersion by minimisation of the adhesion between pigment particles and maximisation of the adhesion and cohesion within the dispersion system will be discussed.},

  abstract = {.The full three-dimensional velocity distributions of decelerated and accelerated particles in a Stark decelerator for Rydberg atoms and molecules have been measured. In the experiment, argon atoms in a supersonic beam are excited to low-field and high-field seeking Stark states with principal quantum number in the range n=15 to 25 and are decelerated in a 3 mm long decelerator consisting of four electrodes on which time-dependent voltages are applied. The time dependence of the resulting inhomogeneous electric field is chosen such that the decelerating force acting on the high-field seeking states is maximized at each point along the trajectories. The three-dimensional velocity distribution of the atoms before and after the deceleration is determined by measuring times of flight and two-dimensional images of the atomic cloud on the detector. Under optimal deceleration conditions, the decrease in kinetic energy in the longitudinal dimension amounts to 1.0\texttimes{}10-21 J and the increase in mean kinetic energy in the transverse dimensions is only 1.0\texttimes{}10-23 J. The corresponding temperatures of 100 mK and 300 mK in the two transverse dimensions are sufficiently low that trapping can be envisaged. The possibility of focusing a Rydberg atom beam is demonstrated experimentally.},

From a flat grid, two broad beams of molecules with continuous distribution of their energy from zero up to e(U + U c ) (where U is voltage between the grid and the vacuum chamber and U c is cathode fall of the discharge) are propagating in opposite directions. The beam propagating from the concave surface of a 0.2-m-diameter grid is focused within a 10-mm-diameter spot on the target surface. When a 0.2-m-diameter 0.2-m-high cylindrical grid covered by end disks and composed of parallel 1.5-mm-diameter knitting needles spaced by 4.5 mm is immersed in the plasma, the accelerated ions pass through the gaps between the needles, turn inside the grid into fast atoms or molecules, and escape from the grid through the gaps on its opposite side. The Doppler shift of spectral lines allows for measuring the fast atom energy, which corresponds to the potential difference between the plasma inside the chamber and the plasma produced as a result of charge-exchange collisions inside the cylindrical grid.},

The dielectric constant and refractive index of any gas are examples of macroscopic properties that are largely determined by the dipole polarizability. When it comes to microscopic phenomena, the existence of alkaline-earth anions and the recently discovered ability of positrons to bind to many atoms are predominantly due to the polarization interaction. An imperfect knowledge of atomic polarizabilities is presently looming as the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster calculations sometimes combined with precise experimental data for selected transitions, microwave spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms and ions, refractive index measurements in microwave cavities, ab initio calculations of atomic structures using explicitly correlated wavefunctions, interferometry with atom beams and velocity changes of laser cooled atoms induced by an electric field. This review examines existing theoretical methods of determining atomic and ionic polarizabilities, and discusses their relevance to various applications with particular emphasis on cold-atom physics and the metrology of atomic frequency standards.},

The atoms are assumed to be in different Rydberg states, e.g., in the {$\mid$}ns{\~n} and {$\mid$}np{\~n} states. The resonant dipole-dipole interactions yield symmetric and antisymmetric excitons, with energy splitting that give rise to new resonances as the atoms approach each other. Only away from these resonances can the van der Waals coefficients, C6sp, be defined. We calculate the C6 coefficients for alkali atoms and present the results for lithium by applying perturbation theory. At short interatomic distances of several mm, we show that the widely used simple model of two-level systems for excitons in Rydberg atoms breaks down, and the correct representation implies multi-level atoms. Even though, at larger distances one can keep the twolevel systems but in including van der Waals interactions among the atoms .},

  abstract = {Recent investigations of Rydberg atoms are described in an effort to give a picture of their properties, many of which can be understood from the behaviour of the Coulomb radial functions. The authors begin by a discussion of Coulomb wavefunctions, and progress to a description of the energy level structure. The behaviour of Rydberg atoms in electric fields is discussed to provide an understanding of the phenomenon and to show how electric field ionisation may be used as a tool in a wide variety of experiments. Unique opportunities to study the interaction with black-body radiation and vacuum fluctuations are discussed. A survey of the broad range of Rydberg atom collisions, with ground-state atoms and molecules, charged particles and other Rydberg atoms, is presented to show the different physical interactions responsible. This is followed by a brief summary of the study of autoionising Rydberg states, a stepping stone toward the elusive 'double Rydberg' atom. Finally typical experimental procedures are described.},

Laser sustained plasmas have demonstrated temperatures of 10 000 K in xenon, 18 000 K in argon, and a predicted temperature of 30 000 K in helium. Combining this plasma with hydrodynamic expansion techniques should produce atomic beam velocities greater than 10 km/s for many species. Initial experiments with xenon using 70 W of CO2 laser power have demonstrated beam kinetic temperatures of 8\textendash{}9000 K with Mach numbers of 4\textendash{}6 resulting in peak velocities for xenon of 1.5 km/s (1.5 eV).

  abstract = {A 60 keV neutral lithium beam system was designed and built up for beam emission spectroscopy measurement of edge plasma on the KSTAR and EAST tokamaks. The electron density profile and its fluctuation can be measured using the accelerated lithium beam-based emission spectroscopy system. A thermionic ion source was developed with a SiC heater to emit around 4-5 mA ion current from a 14 mm diameter surface. The ion optic is following the 2 step design used on other devices with small modifications to reach about 2-3 cm beam diameter in the plasma at about 4 m from the ion source. A newly developed recirculating sodium vapour neutralizer neutralizes the accelerated ion beam at around 260-280 \textdegree{}C even during long ({$<$}20 s) discharges. A set of new beam diagnostic and manipulation techniques are applied to allow optimization, aiming, cleaning, and beam modulation. The maximum 60 keV beam energy with 4 mA ion current was successfully reached at KSTAR and at EAST. Combined with an efficient observation system, the Li-beam diagnostic enables the measurement of the density profile and fluctuations on the plasma turbulence time scale.},

  isbn = {978-1-4377-7885-4},
  abstract = {This chapter discusses the supersonic nano-particle beam technique for removing nano-sized containment particles from surfaces. Particulate contamination seriously affects the manufacturing yield of micrometer- and sub-micrometer-scale devices. Various nanotechnology-based devices with feature dimensions in the nanometer size range will also be marketed in time, which may accelerate the size level for contamination control to decrease. Although the theoretical adhesion force for the contaminant particles in the nanometer range is linearly proportional to the particle size, the fluid-dynamic drag force is proportional to the second power of particle size, so the use of drag force for cleaning becomes less efficient as the contaminant size is decreased. The new aerosol cleaning technique based on nano-sized particles/droplets, instead of micrometer-sized particles/droplets used in the conventional aerosol cleaning techniques, can overcome the 50 nm particle size barriers and remove contaminant particles of ceramics, polymers, and metallic copper down to 20 nm with nearly 100\% efficiency. Key to the successful cleaning of nanosized contaminant particles is the combination of smaller bullet size and a higher velocity. Bullet particles satisfying these requirements can be generated in two different ways e supersonic expansion and electrospray. In the supersonic expansion technique, solid bullet particles are generated by homogeneous nucleation and growth, where particle size and velocity are controlled by the gas composition, nozzle contour, and stagnation conditions pressure and temperature.},

This dispersion serves to measure both the strength and the position dependence of the atom-surface potential in the range from 5 to 10 nm from the surface, and it can also set new limits on non-Newtonian gravity in the 2 nm range.},

From these data we deduce the strength of the VdW potential and its dependence on the atom-surface separation. We discuss how our measurements can be used to set limits on the strength of non-Newtonian gravity at short length scales and we discuss the possibility of measuring the atom-surface interactions over a larger range of atom-surface distances.

In The Quantum Vacuum, Peter Milonni describes the concept of the vacuum in quantum physics with an emphasis on quantum electrodynamics. He elucidates in depth and detail the role of the vacuum electromagnetic field in spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, van der Waals, and Casimir forces, and a variety of other phenomena, some of which are of technological as well as purely scientific importance. This informative text also provides an introduction based on fundamental vacuum processes to the ideas of relativistic quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory, including renormalization and Feynman diagrams. Experimental as well as theoreticalaspects of the quantum vacuum are described, and in most cases details of mathematical derivations are included. Chapter 1 of The Quantum Vacuum - published in advance in The American Journal of Physics (1991)-was later selected by readers as one of the Most Memorable papers ever published in the 60-year history of the journal. This chapter provides anexcellent beginning of the book, introducing a wealth of information of historical interest, the results of which are carefully woven into subsequent chapters to form a coherent whole.Does not assume that the reader has taken advanced graduate courses, making the text accessible to beginning graduate studentsEmphasizes the basic physical ideas rather than the formal, mathematical aspects of the subjectProvides a careful and thorough treatment of Casimir and van der Waals forces at a level of detail not found in any other book on this topicClearly presents mathematical derivations},

  abstract = {The understanding and where possible the minimisation of decoherence mechanisms in electron microscopy were first studied in plasmon loss, diffraction contrast images but are of even more acute relevance in high resolution TEM phase contrast imaging and electron holography. With the development of phase retrieval techniques they merit further attention particularly when their effect cannot be eliminated by currently available energy filters. The roles of electronic excitation, thermal diffuse scattering, transition radiation and bremsstrahlung are examined here not only in the specimen but also in the electron optical column. Terahertz-range aloof beam electronic excitation appears to account satisfactorily for recent observations of decoherence in electron holography. An apparent low frequency divergence can emerge for the calculated classical bremsstrahlung event probability but can be ignored for photon wavelengths exceeding the required coherence distance or path lengths in the equipment. Most bremsstrahlung event probabilities are negligibly important except possibly in large-angle bending magnets or mandolin systems. A more reliable procedure for subtracting thermal diffuse scattering from diffraction pattern intensities is proposed.},

  abstract = {Massive-particle interferometry can provide tests of fundamental ideas in quantum mechanics, due to the presence of mass and charge, not possible with the more familiar optical interferometry. Most importantly, since the first observation of electron diffraction in 1927 by Davisson, Germer and Thomson [1] (and the observation of electron Fresnel edge fringes by Boersch in 1940 [2]), it has been clear that matter diffracts, according to de Broglie's 1924 hypothesis. ({$\blackpointerright$} Davisson-Germer Experiment) The subsequent demonstration of Young's pinhole and biprism experiments (discussed below) with {$\blackpointerright$} electrons about fifty years ago has since led to astonishing demonstrations of, for example, the diffraction of beams of buckyballs by a grating [3] and effects of gravity on neutron interferometry [4]. For neutrons and electrons, both Fermions, new effects due to {$\blackpointerright$} spin and the {$\blackpointerright$} exclusion principle might also be expected, not seen with photons ({$\blackpointerright$} light quantum). Perhaps the most famous experiments to date have been tests of the {$\blackpointerright$} Aharonov-Bohm effect using electrons, and those using neutrons to see the effects of gravity on interference, but there have been many more (including an electron Sagnac interferometer and experiments on {$\blackpointerright$} decoherence). The separate but closely related field of electron holography has come to prominence in recent decades, with applications in materials science and superconducting vortex imaging. Here we briefly review work on electron interferometry, first reviewed at an early stage by Denis Gabor [5], and also provide some guidance to the rapidly growing contemporary electron holography literature. Historically, it is of interest to note that the analysis of multiple scattering, and the role of the mean inner potential, in the experiments of Davisson and Germer by H. Bethe in his thesis work introduced Floquet's theorem into condensed matter physics for periodic structures, leading to the review article which founded modern condensed matter physics [6]. Bethe and Bloch were both students of A. Sommerfeldin 1928.The construction of an electron interferometer requires a beam-splitter and a small, bright source of electrons. This should be of sufficiently small size d s to produce a spatial coherence width L c which spans the beam-splitter. (L c \textasciitilde{} {$\lambda$}/{$\Theta$} c for a source at distance L \& d s /(2{$\Theta$} c ) from the beamsplitter). Prior to the development of the field-emission electron source in 1968 [7] the use of heated tungsten wire pointed filaments produced values of L c {$<$} 1 micrometer, so that early workers understood the need for an extremely small beamsplitting device, which limited development of the field. But even before the peak of interest in the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the 1960s, both amplitude and wavefront dividing beamsplitters had been demonstrated for electron beams. The first, using Bragg scattering [8], has since been abandoned in favor of the Mollenstedt and Duker electrostatic biprism, which may be said to have founded the field of electron interferometry [9].},

Our treatment reveals an unprecedented feature of matter-wave propagation, namely the appearance of a non-local double-path phase coherence. In the standard interpretation of interferometers, one associates well-defined separate phases to individual paths. Our non-local phase coherence is instead associated to pairs of paths. It arises from the coarse-graining over the quantized electromagnetic field and internal atomic degrees of freedom, which play the role of a common reservoir for the pair of paths and lead to a non-Hamiltonian evolution of the atomic waves. We develop a diagrammatic interpretation and estimate the non-local phase for realistic experimental parameters.},

Above 1 THz we measure significantly more absorption for sapphire, while for quartz our values are in reasonable agreement with those of the previous work. Our results on high-purity fused silica are consistent with those on the most transparent fused silica measured to date. For the semiconductors, we show that many of the previous measurements on silicon were dominated by the effects of carriers due to impurities. For high-resistivity, 10-k{$\Omega$} cm silicon, we measure a remarkable transparency together with an exceptionally nondispersive index of refraction. For GaAs our measurements extend the precision of the previous work, and we resolve two weak absorption features at 0.4 and 0.7 THz.

A long-standing question for stochastic electrodynamics (SED) is whether or not it is capable of reproducing such effects, as interference is a manifestation of quantum coherence. In this study, we used excited harmonic oscillators to directly test this quantum feature in SED. We used two counter-propagating dichromatic laser pulses to promote a ground-state harmonic oscillator to a squeezed Schr\&ouml;dinger cat state. Upon recombination of the two well-separated wavepackets, an interference pattern emerges in the quantum probability distribution but is absent in the SED probability distribution.

For the electric polarizability of the neutron a value of {$\alpha$}n {$\backsimeq$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-3fm3, similar to that of the proton, is expected from quark model calculations. The smallness of {$\alpha$}n makes a measurement based on macroscopic electric fields available with present technology impossible, and a neutron Compton scattering experiment seems unfeasible without a free neutron target at least 5 to 10 orders of magnitude more dense than in the core of present day high flux reactors. In the strong electric field near the surface of heavy nuclei, effects due to the electric polarizability of the neutron contribute up to 1\% of the total neutron atom scattering for {$\alpha$}n {$\backsimeq$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-3fm3. Here the 1r4 interaction potential gives a characteristic scattering contribution proportional to the momentum transfer hq which can be separated from nuclear and atomic effects in keV neutron scattering experiments. In a new neutron transmission experiment on Pb at energies {$<$} 50 keV at the HELIOS neutron source in Harwell, the electric polarizability of the neutron was determined from the energy dependence of the total scattering cross section to be {$\alpha$}n = (1.2 {$\pm$} 1.0) \texttimes{} 10-3 fm3, giving 90\% confidence for a nonzero positive value of {$\alpha$}n.

Electron diffraction out to the 20th order was observed indicating the high quality of our nanofabricated gratings. The electron beam is collimated to its diffraction limit with ion-milled material slits. Our path integral analysis is first tested against single slit electron diffraction, and then further expanded with the same theoretical approach to describe grating diffraction. Rotation of the grating with respect to the incident electron beam varies the effective distance between the electron and grating bars. This allows the measurement of the image charge potential between the electron and the grating bars. Image charge potentials that were about 15\% of the value for that of a pure electron-metal wall interaction were found.

The interaction time is of the order of typical metal image charge response times and in principle allows the investigation of image charge formation. In addition to the image charge interaction there is a dephasing process reducing the transverse coherence length of the electron wave.

  isbn = {978-3-540-70626-7},
  abstract = {The term decoherence is used in many fields of (quantum) physics to describe the disappearance or absence of certain superpositions of quantum states. Decoherence is a consequence of the unavoidable interaction of virtually all physical systems with their environment. In particular, macroscopic objects must be strongly entangled if quantum theory is universally valid [1,2]. Decoherence then explains within quantum theory why macroscopic objects seem to possess their familiar classical properties. No additional classical concepts are required for a consistent quantum description. Decoherence explains, for example, why particles appear localized in space (hence there is no need for an additional particle concept). Contradictory levels of description (classical and quantum) are no longer needed, instead a consistent description in terms of a universal {$\blackpointerright$} wave function can be pursued.The basic mechanism of decoherence is the unavoidable and generally irreversible disappearance of certain phase relations from the states of (local) systems by interaction with their environment according to the {$\blackpointerright$} Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Equivalently, decoherence describes irreversibly increasing entanglement as a consequence of a unitary global dynamics. Phase relations between certain states of a system are preserved globally (because of the assumed unitarity), but are no longer locally accessible, thus leading to apparent non-unitarity \textemdash{} or, in other words \textemdash{} to an apparent violation of the quantum {$\blackpointerright$} superposition principle. This non-unitarity can be described as a disappearance of non-diagonal (in a certain basis) elements of the {$\blackpointerright$} density matrix characterizing the local system. The two most important consequences of decoherence are suppression of interference and the selection of a set of preferred (dynamically stable) states.},

The specificenergy loss of the beam and the probability of excitation of surface and bulk modes in the medium are calculated. Beams both external and internal with the medium are considered, and the predictions are compared with well known non-retarded limits. A detailed analysis of the expressions derived is provided for electron beams interacting with specific dielectric materials. The effects of retardation are seen to be large, particularly for beam energy losses in regions where the real part of the dielectric constant is large. The retarded excitation probability is typically about 10-30\% larger than the non-retarded result, for electron energies greater than about 100keV. The image force is calculated for an external beam, and the radiative de-excitation of the medium is also analysed.},

The MMMOT provided a continuous beam with a tunable velocity. This beam was then directed through the waist of a cavity with a length of 280 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m, resulting in a vacuum Rabi splitting of more than {$\pm$}10 MHz. The presence of a sufficient number of atoms in the cavity mode also enabled splitting in the polarization perpendicular to the input. The cavity was in the strong coupling region, with an atom-photon dipole coupling coefficient g of 7 MHz, a cavity mode decay rate {$\kappa$} of 3 MHz, and a spontaneous emission decay rate {$\gamma$} of 6 MHz.},

The resulting values of 815 618 181.57(18) and 815 606 727.59(18) MHz, respectively, for 7Li and 6Li are in agreement with previous measurements but are more accurate by an order of magnitude. There is still a discrepancy of about 11.6 and 10.6 MHz from the latest theoretical values. This is comparable to the uncertainty in the theoretical calculations, while uncertainty in our experimental values is more than a hundred-fold smaller. More accurate theoretical calculation of the transition frequencies would allow extraction of the absolute charge radii for these stable isotopes, which in turn could improve nuclear charge radii values for the unstable lithium isotopes.},

The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N = 3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N = 769); (2) highly educated employees (N = 592); and (3) higher education students (N = 333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32\% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially workfamily interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor's leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.},

The hydrodynamic model captures much of the microscopic dynamics relating to the fundamental quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and reveals intrinsic limitations to the confinement and enhancement of light around nanoscale features.

Concerning the electromagnetic response of nanoplasmonic systems, several hydrodynamic models have been proposed, each introducing an additional boundary condition (ABC) to describe the behavior of the plasmonic electron cloud. Four hydrodynamic approaches with four different boundary conditions are compared: the hard wall hydrodynamic model with the Sauter ABC, the curl-free hydrodynamic model with the Pekar ABC, the shear forces hydrodynamic model with the specular reflection ABC, and the quantum hydrodynamic model with the corresponding ABC. This is done by investigating near- and far-field features of a metallic nanosphere. It is shown that different hydrodynamic models may result in an entirely different prediction of the nanoparticle's response. These models are validated by using other local and nonlocal response models and experimental results.},

The boundary conditions and linearised differential equations are established without cutoff; they determine the normal modes and orthogonality relations. The model is quantised through its normal modes, and the equal-time commutation rules are discussed. The equations in Fourier space are found; it is argued that a cutoff, if required, should be imposed on the Hamiltonian in this representation and before diagonalisation, and the consequences are explored. With such a cutoff, surface though not bulk modes become dispersive even when beta =0. The formalism is applied briefly to image potentials, and in more detail to the attraction between two half-spaces; the role of bulk modes (when beta {$>$}0) is stressed; the asymptotics are discussed at long and short distances.},

  abstract = {Background
Over the past four years, the Franciscan University Counseling Center has reported a 231\% increase in yearly visits, as well as a 173\% increase in total yearly clients. This trend has been observed at many universities as mental health issues pose significant problems for many college students. The objective of this study was to investigate potential correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of college students.
Methods
The final analyzed sample consisted of 374 undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 24 attending Franciscan University, Steubenville, Ohio. Subjects completed a survey consisting of demographic questions, a section instructing participants to rate the level of concern associated with challenges pertinent to daily life (e.g. academics, family, sleep), and the 21 question version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21).
Results
The results indicated that the top three concerns were academic performance, pressure to succeed, and post-graduation plans. Demographically, the most stressed, anxious, and depressed students were transfers, upperclassmen, and those living off-campus.
Conclusions
With the propensity for mental health issues to hinder the success of college students, it is vital that colleges continually evaluate the mental health of their students and tailor treatment programs to specifically target their needs.},

Method: Taking into account those data offered by the European Statistics Office (EUROSTAT), this study will try to explain, through the multiple linear regression model, suicide rates in European countries from demographic variables (number of inhabitants, divorce rate, ratio of women), economic variables (Gross Domestic Product (GDP), general government gross debt), social variables (government expenditure on social protection, population at risk of poverty) or educational variables (public expenditure on education and population with secondary education). Conclusions: A model to explain suicide rates in different countries was developed.

Goodman Book Writing Award for his work on Nonlinear Optics, 2nd edition.Nonlinear optics is essentially the study of the interaction of strong laser light with matter. It lies at the basis of the field of photonics, the use of light fields to control other light fields and to perform logical operations. Some of the topics of this book include the fundamentals and applications of optical systems based on the nonlinear interaction of light with matter. Topics to be treated include: mechanisms of optical nonlinearity, second-harmonic and sum- and difference-frequency generation, photonics and optical logic, optical self-action effects including self-focusing and optical soliton formation, optical phase conjugation, stimulated Brillouin and stimulated Raman scattering, and selection criteria of nonlinear optical materials.{$\cdot$} Covers all the latest topics and technology in this ever-evolving area of study that forms the backbone of the major applications of optical technology{$\cdot$} Offers first-rate instructive style making it ideal for self-study{$\cdot$} Emphasizes the fundamentals of non-linear optics rather than focus on particular applications that are constantly changing},

The development avoids all expansions of the response in powers of the driving forces. The generalized response coefficients thus provide the basis for calculations of nonlinear effects in those situations for which expansions in powers of the forces are not suitable. It is shown how the linear and higher-order response functions obtained first by Kubo can be obtained in a relatively more compact way. The expressions corresponding to static forces are considered in some detail. Generalized response coefficients are also derived for systems in equilibrium; the lowest order of these is just the isothermal susceptibility as usually defined.},

As our aim is to apply our formalism to light scattering at surfaces of arbitrary materials, we derive the Green's function in a surface representation. The only requirement on the material is that it should have periodicity parallel to the surface. We calculate this Green's function for light of a specific frequency and a specific incident direction and distance with respect to the surface. The material properties entering the Green's function are the reflection coefficients for plane waves at the surface. Using the close relationship between the Green's function and the density of states (DOS), we apply our method to calculate the spontaneous emission rate as a function of the distance to a material surface. The spontaneous emission rate can be calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule, which can be expressed in terms of the DOS of the optical modes available to the emitted photon. We present calculations for a finite slab of cylindrical rods, embedded in air on a square lattice. It is shown that the enhancement or suppression of spontaneous emission strongly depends on the frequency of the light.},

  abstract = {Quantum fluctuations associated with the ground state of a system exist as a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. These fluctuating fields manifest themselves indirectly through their influence on matter which has been extensively studied by considering e.g. the Casimir and Casimir-Polder force. More recently, these ground state fluctuations have been measured directly using nonlinear crystals by means of electro-optical sampling. Despite their common origin, these direct versus indirect evidence of ground-state fluctuations remain disjoint phenomena to date. Here we develop a theoretical framework for describing propagation of a quantized electric field through a nonlinear crystal, allowing for arbitrarily-shaped dispersive and absorptive environments. It can be used in different contexts, one of which is to forge the missing link between the different approaches to observing the quantum vacuum mentioned above. To demonstrate this we show that the change of the vacuum fluctuations induced by a macroscopic object can be directly observed using electro-optical sampling.},

We show that the imaginary part can be changed by a factor of up to 100 relative to its value in the absence of graphene. We also show that the resonance in the case of the grating is narrower than in the continuous sheet. In the case of the grating it is shown that the resonance can be tuned by changing the grating geometric parameters.},

We sequentially derive the expressions for both out-of-plane and in-plane fields of both polarizations. It is shown that the analytical approximation provided is very precise in a wide range of distances from a point source, down to a deep subwavelength region (1/100 of wavelength). We separate the contribution from the pole, the branch point and discuss their interference.

The dipole is located near an interface with a layer with uniform material parameters {$\epsilon$}2 and {$\mu$}2, and the second interface borders a uniform medium with parameters {$\epsilon$}3 and {$\mu$}3. We have obtained the solutions for the electric and magnetic fields in the various regions, without any restrictions on the parameters and for any state of oscillation of the dipole (elliptical, in general). The solution involves a set of auxiliary functions, which are given as integral representations containing the Fresnel coefficients for plane waves. With this solution, the field lines of energy flow can be obtained, and we have considered the flow pattern for the simple case of a dipole oscillating perpendicular to the interface. When the material of the layer is optically thicker than the embedding medium of the dipole, energy flows more or less along straight lines. At an interface, the field lines refract, similar to optical rays. When the layer material is optically thinner, the energy flow lines curve. A portion of the energy that propagates toward the interface bends away from it before reaching the interface. Other field lines of energy flow cross the interface, but then return to the area of the dipole by crossing the interface again. This leads to an oscillation of energy back and forth through the interface. In the neighborhood of this oscillation, a concentric set of vortex tori appears.},
