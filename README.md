# QuaCa
**QuaCa** stands for Quantum / Casimir Friction and is a numerical framework to calculate just that.
With QuaCa you can calculate quantum friction at finite temperatures, with atoms or nanoparticles, rolling or non-rolling, etc.

QuaCa is currently developed in a private git repository, by main developer and maintainer Marty Oelschlager (marty@mbi-berlin.de) with help of co-developer Christoph Egerland.

## Install
To get the code simply type
```
git clone git@git.physik.hu-berlin.de:egerlanc/quaca.git QuaCa
